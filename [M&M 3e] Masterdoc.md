* ## **\[M\&M 3e\] World of Aranth (PEACH)**

* **Introduction**  
*   
*   
* The world is called Aranth, and this document focuses primarily on the country of Ilessia, which shares the continent Aldonis with the country of Limbra. Ilessia and Limbra are largely friendly rivals; they have a history of on-and-off warfare up until some three centuries ago, and remain economic competitors (and have their share of military rivalries), but also enjoy lots of trade and a strong military alliance.  
*   
* Superhumans are commonly referred to as Dreamers, since their powers are always heralded by very vivid, lucid Dreams. Several terms have been used to mean people without Dreamer powers, with "Sleepers" being the most common. The nation of Paradisia, the Big Dreams Inc. organization, and most people who feel Dreamers are deserving of a certain elevated status tend to use "Mundanes" instead. The terms "Unpowered" or "Non-Dreamers" are more technical and tend to be favored by SIDE, IDEA, and others who prefer a more precise or clinical distinction (with Unpowered expanding to mean anyone without any sort of external or Spiritual Energy fueled enhancements, and Non-Dreamers simply meaning anyone who isn't an actual Dreamer). The Reclaimers, and others with anti-Dreamer sentiments, tend to use the term "Normals" to refer to people without Dreamer powers. Finally, the Seekers of the Dream and others who believe that Dreamer powers are a thing that humanity as a whole is gradually developing have been known to refer to those without Dreamer powers as "Potentials".  
*   
* The Dreams are always related to the powers involved, though they can range from clear depictions of the Dreamer wielding its powers, to value symbolism. Some Dreams have proven to be prophetic, and others of an historical nature, like a memory of a past life. Where the Dreams, and the attendant powers, actually come from remains unknown, despite the best efforts of scientists and Dreamers with divination-related powers alike, though theories abound. There are few if any hard limits on what Dreamer powers are capable of, and it has largely been concluded that "Dreamer powers can absolutely prove anything \- even something that has been absolutely disproven by another Dreamer's power." For example, there's no evidence that parallel dimensions are a thing in Aranth \- but Dreamers who have powers that interact with parallel dimensions exist. The only way to interact with those dimensions appears to be through the powers of, or at least in connection with, those Dreamers. As far as their powers are concerned, those dimensions absolutely exist. But whether they would still exist if those Dreamers didn't have those specific powers...well, who knows?

  Aside from the Dream, how powers manifest (often referred to as the Dreamer "Awakening") can vary widely. Some Dreamers have their Dream and wake up with new powers immediately. Some Dreamers can go hours, weeks, months, or even years between having their Dream and actually manifesting a power. Some people forget the Dream entirely, or don't recognize it for what it is, while others find it seared into their memories. Some Dreamers only have the one Dream, others have multiple Dreams or even have their Dream repeatedly for the rest of their lives. Sometimes the power comes out in times of stress or danger, and sometimes there's some environmental trigger. About half of all Dreamer powers manifest around puberty, and another third around full adulthood, but they can come at any time \- there have been recorded cases of people being born with Dreamer powers, and even acquiring them on their deathbeds. More Dreamers in an area seems to correlate to a higher rate of development, and more Dreamers in a family seems to increase the odds of later descendents being Dreamers, but these aren't certainties. Some Dreamers swear roundly that they "unlocked" their Dream through training, meditation, prayer, or the like. All in all, pretty much any classic superhero origin story could play a part in an Awakening. But there is always a Dream.

  As best anyone can tell, Dreamers have existed for a long time, but they've been relatively rare and often low-profile. The first documented case that modern science is fully confident was an actual Dreamer was around a thousand years ago. That said, there are plenty of (quasi?)-historical or mythological stories dating back as much as seven-thousand years that *could* have been Dreamers, or could have just been exaggerated/romanticized history (think Romance of the Three Kingdoms type stories). As communication and mass media developed, Dreamer sightings became more common and more apparent to the public. Many Dreamers during this time relied on secret identities to avoid notice. Public reaction to living, breathing superheroes was...mixed.

  This state kept up for a little more than a century. During this time, Dreamer powers were poorly understood \- the Dreams themselves were pretty much unknown outside the Dreamers, who didn't realize they were common to each other. Bits and pieces of data was gathered, but peoples' understanding of Dreamers was very limited.

  That changed in what has come to be called the Year of the Awakening (Year 0 PA, which in terms of technological and sociological development was roughly equivalent to modern-day Earth). Several powerful Dreamers officially revealed their identities to the world, and began the organization which would grow into the Assembly of Dreams. Over the next several decades, Dreamers became a fixture of modern society. Advanced, super-science inventions (commonly called Dreamtech) were developed by Dreamers with such powers as super-intelligence or hyper-creativity, and while such technology was limited in several important ways, it still shot modern technology centuries ahead of where it had been.

  It is currently the year 124 PA (Post Awakening). Approximately one percent of people have had a Dream, although only about one percent of *them* have powers of significant note. Being a Dreamer is considered a major and valuable skill; even the most minor of powers can often be put to good use. Dreamers with serious powers have a vast array of life options, and in some nations are often celebrities in their own right. Dreamers are in many ways as significant a part of modern society as computers in the modern day, if not quite so ubiquitous; information on Dreamer powers are taught in schools, including such things as basic knowledge of how to discern and resist psychic invasions, recognize illusions, and other basic defensive measures against Dreamer powers.

  **Life On Aranth**

  Technology on Aranth is highly advanced, although a lot of it is difficult to mass-produce. Generally, it's worth assuming that general society has access to modern technology with some advancements (flying cars and jetpacks, for example, exist). Militaries, large corporations, the fabulously wealthy, and of course, super-genius and gadgeteer style characters, can have access to all manner of incredibly advanced tech. Things like powered armor, mechs, matter generators, laser weaponry, teleportation, nano-technology, and similar incredibly technology does exist, but is very limited and currently impossible to mass produce.

  Year 0 PA was roughly technologically equivalent to modern-day Earth, so Aranth has over a century of additional technological advancement. Dreamtech, and scientific breakthroughs derived thereby, also mean that in certain fields, technological achievements even more advanced or impossible under real-world physics do exist, though they tend to be rare. As a general rule of thumb, if it exists today on Earth, even as a prototype or proof-of-concept, there's a good chance that it's available on Aranth.

  This is a sampling of the sort of technology available on the world. Just about any sort of technological item is possible as a Device. Devices can also be supernaturally imbued with powers by Dreamers with artifice powers.

  **Armor:** The most common type of armor is lightweight body armor that provides ranks in Protection, though people who want to invest in their defense can just as easily acquire "Dreamer Class" armor that provides Impervious protection. Both types are available as Equipment up to rank 5\. All other forms of armor must be purchased as Devices.

  Some more advanced armors are also built in with tactical computers and some robotics, a sort of "lesser powered armor", granting Enhanced Dodge and Enhanced Parry. Armor can also include power dampeners and other protective measures to provide Enhanced Fortitude and Enhanced Will.

  Two of the most common forms of professional defensive gear are forcefield projectors and powered armor. Powered armor generally includes at least Protection and Enhanced Strength, and some also include tactical computers (Enhanced Dodge and Parry or Enhanced Fighting) and power dampeners (Enhanced Fortitude and Will). More advanced versions also include mobility tools such as jet boots (Speed with a Leaping Alternate) or jet packs (Flight), Life Support systems, and various sensor suites. Professional and military grade powered armor also typically include weapons systems.

  Forcefield projectors are more subtle than powered armor, typically built into accessories (belts are the most common) and generally provide straight Protection, but more advanced versions can include deflector fields (Enhanced Dodge and Parry) and power dampeners (Enhanced Fortitude and Will).

  Naturally, specialized versions of both these types of items that do other things are perfectly viable, but these are the most common options.

  Finally, getting to the point where calling it "armor" is rather ludicrous, giant mechs do exist in setting. These devastating war machines are typically PL 15+, and typically decked out with all the bells and whistles. Power dampeners, enough weaponry (ballistic, explosive, and laser) to level a large city backed by extreme super-strength, loads of Impervious Toughness, neural uplinks networked to tactical computers, nanite regeneration and ammo generation, supersonic flight, and usually a special trick or two to boot.

  **Communications:** Even on modern day Earth, communication technology is pretty flat-out amazing. The cellular network on Aranth is pretty much ubiquitous; you can get a wireless internet connection and perfect phone signal pretty much anywhere except deep underground or in places specifically designed to not allow access.

  It is suggested that in most modern societies, characters are assumed to have access to a full-featured smartphone (Phone, Computer, Video/Audio Recorder, GPS, Camera, Flashlight, plus various sundry apps) at no Equipment cost, for descriptive and plot purposes. However, unless actually purchased with EP, the GM can freely cause phones to arbitrarily fail whenever used "tactically", such as to call in aid or interface for a Technology check. Lacking such a phone entirely in a modern society could be part of a Complication.

  **Computers:** Most significant computer systems are composed of what's called "active crystal". Despite the fancy name, it's basically high-tech glass. Although designed as Dreamtech, it has been perfected and is considered standard technology at this point. Active crystal can function as a computer, touchscreen, monitor, sensor, and more, depending on its programming, and it's quite tough and bullet-resistant (typically Impervious Toughness 6, more with greater thickness or for tempered varieties).

  The most typical setup is the Active Crystal Computer Station. This consists of three sheets of active crystal of varying sizes, and a small disk, with a few little plastic connectors and such. All together, they weigh two to three pounds. They are usually small enough to fit in a good-sized briefcase or backpack. In a normal configuration, they are set up like a modern desktop computer, with the largest sheet serving as the monitor, the middle sheet being the keyboard, and the smallest being the mouse. On the go, the middle sheet can basically function as a tablet and the smaller a smart phone, or the large and middle sheets can be connected together to work as a laptop. All three of the sheets have the same programs and capabilities available.

  The disk is usually worn to serve as a sort of wristwatch, bluetooth, headset, or even a monocle.

  An Active Crystal Computer Station costs 10 EP (two ranks of Equipment), providing the benefits of a Computer, Audio/Video Recorder, Cell Phone, Camera, GPS, Flash Light, and Commlink. The other two EP are for the various utility functions of modern apps, programs, networking, and having four durable little devices all synched up together that all function as the above. A character with Wealth 1 or higher may substitute the free smartphone for a free ACCS, subject to the same limitations.

  Less common are full-fledged Dreamtech versions of Active Crystal, which extend the above features with such things as holographic displays and a neural linkup, allowing the user to use its own senses as "output" and thoughts or movements as "input". This basically doubles the cost of the relevant types of equipment (Computer, Camera, Audio/Video recorder, and Commlink, generally). So an Active Crystal Computer Station using Dreamtech active crystal would be 15 EP or 3 PP. These tools should not be available freely.

  Computer systems added to headquarters generally mean any glass in the Headquarters is active crystal. By taking the Computer feature for the headquarters a second time, at least some of the glass is the Dreamtech version (how much generally depending on the overall value of the Headquarters, the character's Wealth benefits, etc).

  **Economy and Energy:** [Totally expanded this into its own post.](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?543730-M-amp-M-3e-World-of-Aranth-\(PEACH\)&p=22627454&viewfull=1#post22627454)

  **Entertainment:** And lots of it. You think we have too many channels? We don't come close. People want to be entertained, and will pay good money for it. Big media corporations control a lot of it, but there's comparatively a good bit more independent entertainers making a good living. The country of Ilessia is the biggest and most widely-seen producer of entertainment media in the world, but they are *far* from the only one.

  Of particular note, Dreamer-centric sporting-type shows are *really* popular. Ranging from classic sports (except everyone has powers), to fighting competitions, to entirely new sports designed entirely around specific powers. Also add in the fact that plenty of Dreamers are their own special effects departments (protip: best way to do a really cool blockbuster superhero movie? *Cast actual superheroes\!*). End result, entertainment is a common field for Dreamers, and in fact, *the* most common field of work for Dreamers in Ilessia, hands down (this is also one of the reasons that the Assembly of Dreams has such a tremendous media presence, and one of *their* most common jobs is as agents for the Dreamer celebrities).

  **Medicine:** The thing about medicine is, evolution can be a creep sometimes. Yes, Aranth medical sciences have benefitted from the progression of time. And, yes, the diseases have adapted to keep up in many cases.

  This does change the face of medical sciences some. Viruses, bacterias, fungi, and other *organisms* have been able to evolve. Most medical conditions that are basically "the body not working right" (cancer, allergies, a fair number of genetic diseases, although those are so diverse that new ones that science has never seen before often crop up) are generally curable at this stage. Life expectancy has increased as a result, with the average person living around 125 years if not killed by disease, accident, or violence (and the longest-lived people on the planet, not counting age-retarding powers, are pushing the two-century mark). Most people start feeling the effects of age around 75, and don't start really seeing a significant loss of mental and physical capability until around 100, assuming they have normal access to medical treatments.

  But people do still get sick, sometimes seriously so, and can die as a result. There are still occasional outbreaks and epidemics, and there are diseases out there that are resistant or even immune to modern medicine, Dreamtech medicine, and even Dreamer powers (although a powerful enough Dreamer could potentially cure just about anything). Most major diseases have a specific DC to be cured by powers (often 20+), some are considered Incurable (requiring Persistent healing), and most disallow trying again except with Extra Effort (the Effortless Extra can be added to Healing if you *really* want to be able to obliterate whatever diseases you encounter).

  Several Dreamers with healing powers do work in the medical community, although the natural limitations of Dreamer powers on the large scale mean that medical science is still the primary form of care most people get. Many Dreamer healers either focus their efforts on people with less access to modern medicine (the charitable ones) or make big money healing what science can't (the majority). The best healers, with things like Persistent Effortless Healing or Ultimate Effort (Healing), can become fabulously wealthy.

  There are also diseases out there that specifically affect Dreamers, and may affect their powers in various ways. The ones that cause powers to go uncontrolled can be very, *very* scary.

  **Robotics:** Robots are definitely in\! Robotics on Aranth is leaps and bounds ahead of Earth technology, going whole-hog into the sci-fi genre. Cybernetic enhancement, full-fledged AI, humanoid and even human-appearing robots, nanomachines, and so on all exist.

  Most middle-classed households can be expected to have at least a few low-end robotic devices (that is, automated mechanical and computerized pieces of technology capable of autonomously performing certain tasks in a generally intelligent manner). The more advanced ones \- humanoid robots with full-fledged AI, androids, cybernetics, nanotech, and so on \- are generally the domain of large companies, very wealthy individuals, or skilled inventors who can build and program their own. Robotic soldiers, law enforcement, and guards are not uncommon, though are still less common than human soldiers (they are, however, significantly more common than Dreamer combatants).

  Advanced suits of powered armor, up to and including mechs, can potentially have highly advanced AI and serve as characters or NPCs in their own right.

  **Security:** Security has, naturally, improved substantially. This doesn't inherently mean that meaningful security across the board would be DC 40 or something, though; just as new security measures have been put in place, new means of dealing with them have been devised. A basic security system is generally DC 20, a good one DC 30, and a top-of-the-line one DC 40, but beating them through Technology checks involves using more advanced tools (improvised tools are similarly more advanced; a basic smartphone might qualify as an "improvised tool" for disabling an Aranthian security measure.

  One very common security device is the Power Scanner. One of the first Dreamtech inventions, it is now sufficiently understood to be mass-produced and is considered mundane technology. These scanners are often built into security cameras and similar devices (they're also included in many forms of combat-oriented equipment, such as powered armor, and are standard-issue in SIDE Tactical HUD Helmets). At the most basic, the ones you pick up at the local electronics store, they have a Ranged Visual Detect (Dreamer Powers), basically noting any Dreamers shown. More advanced versions, the sort you'll likely see in military gear and corporate security, are also Acute, giving a broad overview of the Dreamer's powers. Getting even more advanced \- specialized military gear, and SIDE standard-issue \- are also Analytical, provided a full list of powers, including relative strengths and effects.

  On a similar note, pretty much the full range of Senses powers (excepting extreme things like Precognition, Postcognition, and ludicrously specialized Detects and such) are generally available as security measures, at various costs. High-end security systems can detect a vast array of threats, but those are usually only installed in highly restricted areas (or by the truly paranoid).

  Again aside from really crazy stuff, pretty much any Senses power can be purchased as Equipment as part of an Installation or Vehicle. Personal and portable Senses Equipment is generally limited to: Extended Vision or Hearing 1 (potentially up to 4 with some hindrances on use, such as focusing in a narrow spot, requiring Concentration, etc), individual Counters Concealment effects that apply to natural phenomena (Darkvision or Counters Concealment \[Weather\] or \[Clouds\] is fine, but not \[Invisibility\] or Counters All Concealment), Rapid Vision or Hearing 1, Direction Sense, Distance Sense, ...technically Time Sense except that's kinda pointless, Infravision, Ultravision, and Tracking. As always, Devices can have any Senses powers you can devise.

  Nullification technology is also often used in security. Power Nullifiers and Power Suppressors are used for prisons and the like designed to hold Dreamers. More selective nullifiers that only work on certain powers are common in government buildings and corporate offices. Almost any location serious about security has some form of Projection Blocker.

* **Spoiler: Common Defense Systems**  
* Hide  
  Individuals can generally be keyed into security systems to allow passage. This is functionally equivalent to Immunity 1 (Installation's Powers; Affects Others), with the time required to key a person in (generally a few minutes) a Quirk buying off the dinky cost. Without authorization, keying yourself into a Defense System requires beating the Installation's Security System with a Technology check. Note, however, that such terminals are generally set up to require physical access (not connected to wi-fi, the internet, etc), barring technopathy or the like.

  Systems are designed at rank 10, but high-security locations can have them as high as rank 15 or even 20\!

  **Dreamer Power Suppressors:** Nullify Dreamer Powers 10 (Perception Range, Burst Area, Broad, Simultaneous, Concentration, Sustained, Limited \[Targets in or on the Installation\]).  
  Each round a Dreamer is in or on the Installation, it must roll Will DC 1d20+10 or lose all Dreamer powers for as long as it remains. Powers with a rank higher than the Dreamer's Will may substitute their rank to determine if they remain active.

  **Dreamer Power Negators:** Affliction 10 (Entranced/Stunned/Transformed; Will; Perception Range, Burst Area 2, Cumulative, Limited \[Powers Only, Transformed removes all powers\], Quirk 2 \[Dreamer powers only\], Limited \[Targets in or on the Installation\]).  
  Each round a Dreamer is in or on the Installation, it must roll Will DC 20 or suffer the Affliction, becoming unable to use or maintain powers unless threatened, then at all, and then losing access to all Dreamer powers, even Permanent and Continuous ones. Powers with a rank higher than the Dreamer's Will may substitute their rank to determine if they remain active. In the first two cases, a new save is allowed each round to throw off the effects, but once powers are fully negated, they're considered disabled for as long as the character remains within. Very large Installations may want to add additional Area ranks to assure the effect can constantly cover the whole building (not a concern for Suppressors thanks to their Sustained Duration letting them set a zone and leave it be).

  **Dreamer Power Nullifiers:** Nullify Dreamer Powers 10 (Broad, Reaction \[Dreamer Power used within\], Limited \[Counters Only\]).  
  Any time a Dreamer tries to use a power within the Installation, it must roll a power rank check opposed by 1d20+10 or the effect is countered. This security option costs two applications of Defense System to purchase regardless of the Installation's PL. It is typically used to prevent active powers while still allowing passive effects to function normally \- often, to block attack powers.

  **Infiltration Blockers:** Infiltration blockers use one of the above templates, but are Limited to powers that influence or affect the mind or perceptions, saving some points/cost. In a lot of cases, they are further Limited to only triggering once per five rounds for a given target for greater savings.

  **Projection Nullifiers:** Nullify Projections 10 (Reaction \[Projection passes through Installation area\], Reduced Range \[Close\], Limited \[Counters Only\]).  
  Projection Nullifiers will attempt to counter any projection (a power that passes through objects) made into, within, or through the Installation at 1d20+10. This form of projection blocker isn't the most reliable, but it is useful for curtailing projections even across open air within the area. This sort of nullifier is also the type easiest to make portable, although in that case some Area ranks have to be added.

  **Projection Blockers:** Immunity 20 (Projections).  
  The most typical form of projection blocker, this makes the installation itself immune to projections, so they can't pass through walls, doors, windows, and other objects within. Projections can be used while within so long as they don't try to pass through objects (so you can teleport down a hall, but not onto the other side of a door).

  **Perfect Projection Blockers:** Immunity 20 (Projections), Create 20 (Limited \[Projections\]).  
  The best you can get, blocks all projections through the physical structure of the Installation, and fills in the Installation with a Created object for purposes of blocking projections.

  Most people carry around an identification card, which basically links them up to various databases and accounts with relevant information. These cards serve a variety of functions serving as ID cards, liscences, debit/credit cards (all such accounts are linked to the card), security cards, passwords, and so on. These cards are very convenient, and also come with a number of built-in security measures. The cards are composed of a plastic material similar to active crystal, and are keyed to the individual's biometrics. For particularly secure capabilities, the cards have a PIN number and a password, and a thumbprint scanner. Finally, the cards can be synched to computerized devices, limiting access if the relevant device isn't nearby, instantly reporting transactions and other events to the device, linking the person to the device's GPS location and other applications, and so on. Notably, synching the card to a device, while very convenient and often required to get full functionality out of a lot of applications, also makes a person generally easier to track (the cards don't have GPS, the devices usually do), and of course open up your various targeted ads, which can be helpful or annoying (advertisers being advertisers, usually the latter). A lot of people do it, for added convenience and security, some are paranoid about it and don't, and some take the best of both worlds and have two devices, leaving one unsynched.

  Most serious security systems have several failsafes; an ID card swipe, synched device, and independent biometric or retinal scan are not uncommon in corporate security. Dreamtech security options include such advanced technology as brainwave scanners, which can detect threats (Senses 1 \[Danger Sense\]), or even outright look into a person's mind to make sure they pass (Mind Reading effects). The most popular version is a brainwave scanner that scans for a specific password in the person's thoughts. These are often hidden, used in conjunction with other security measures, so only people who are supposed to have access to a location even know about them, let alone know the password. And the really crafty use these as the foundation for even more elaborate security measures (multiple thought-codes to send secret alerts, combinations of thought-codes and entered passcodes, and so on). The Assembly of Dreams is noted for their top-level security requiring a password telepathically implanted deep into the person's unconscious; the person doesn't consciously know it so it can't reveal it, anyone who does consciously know it triggers an alert, and passing the checkpoint requires the mind to be fully open to the scan, allowing a thorough mental scan.

  **Space Travel:** Aranth has some fairly advanced space travel, sufficient to fully explore their solar system, although no real efforts have been made to colonize other planets (excepting Paradisia with the moon, but even that effort is in its infancy). There *are* a few individual isolated bases on the moon and other nearby planets, created by powerful Dreamers or Dreamtech scientists, but they're very rare. No alien life has been discovered by the people of Aranth, although given the existence of Dreamers, a notable majority believe it exists (more because "hey, at this point, why not?" than out of any belief of a connection). An abundance of satellites is largely responsible for the world's ubiquitous wireless network capabilities.

  Space has \- sadly \- been weaponized. Most major countries have at least a few military platforms in space \- orbital battleships, satellite weapons platforms, and so on. Every so often there is an outright space battle (typically in low orbit, but space nonetheless). Some forms of modern aircraft (including most state-of-the-art military aircraft as this is in many ways their big advantage over flying tanks and such and pretty much *all* mechs) are designed to be space-capable.

  **Vehicles:** While the common vehicles on Aranth (cars, motorcycles, trucks, etc) haven't developed much in terms of sheer speed or power (largely because such advancements aren't all that necessary) they are vastly more energy-efficient and filled with plenty of cool gizmos. Most of them use Active Crystal for all windows, for more protection, greater range of senses, and more display options. Automated driving is the norm. Safety features are also generally improved, ranging from simply tougher bodies to outright force fields on luxury cars (the latter are even able to pick up and safely carry along pedestrians in the event of a collision).

  Flight is available to the masses. Flying cars, jet bikes, and even personal jetpacks are all available on a middle-class budget. All flying vehicles require GPS tracking (and will not fly without it without extensive modification, a DC 25 Technology check, since this is what ensures they stay in their lane). Even if you can pull the Technology check, flying without the GPS is incredibly dangerous, and is a felony. Flying vehicles are relatively new, really got going a couple decades ago, and aren't quite as ubiquitous as cars are on modern-day Earth, but they're getting there. A substantial number of flying vehicles have low-end forcefield Dreamtech that offers additional protection and cushions falls.

  Get into the big stuff, and the stops all get pulled out. Tanks are flying, and jets are going into space to maintain the advantage. Teleporter technology is very rare and highly energy-intensive, but present (Hero Corps, in particular, uses it extensively). Commercial space travel? As common and routine as Earth air travel (a space flight can get you pretty much anywhere in the world in two to three hours, tops, and a good portion of that is loading, unloading, takeoff, landing, and such; the actual trip rarely takes more than an hour).

  Personal transportation Equipment can include Speed, Swimming, and Leaping (up to rank five and non-arrayed), and any of the following Movement options: Environmental Adaptation, Slithering (I...guess...?), Sure Footed, Swinging, Wall-Crawling, and Water Walking. All other Movement powers have to be taken as Devices to operate on a personal level.

  Vehicles, however, can add in Flight and Burrowing.

  **Weaponry:** Most personal weaponry is broadly classified into three grades: Civilian-grade, professional-grade, and military-grade. Civilian-grade weaponry generally means 2 PP/rank (such as basic Ranged Damage, or a Cumulative Affliction, or Damage Linked to an Affliction, etc). Such weapons are typically in the hands of hunters, the wealthy, criminals, and other people who want to be armed but don't have access to serious weapons. For the majority of Dreamers, offensive powers tend to rate at Civilian-grade.

  Professional-grade weapons are about where most serious real-world weaponry falls on the scale, though perhaps a bit beefier. Professional-grade weaponry generally means 3 PP/rank (such as Ranged Multiattack Damage, Damaged Linked Cumulative Affliction, Perception Range Damage, etc). Such weapons are typically in the hands of vigilantes, mercenaries, law enforcement, and others who have the licenses, authority, or access to get them. Most serious Dreamers, such as Heroes, have offensive powers that rate as equivalent to Professional-grade weapons.

  Military-grade weapons are generally 4 PP/rank (such as Ranged Damage Linked Ranged Weaken Toughness, Ranged Multiattack Concentration Damage, Perception Range Defense-resisted Damage, etc). Such weapons are almost universally in the hands of soldiers or serious, government-backed combatants. Even powerful Dreamers rarely boast military-grade offensive powers unless they have a heavy offensive focus or military training.

  For some examples of the more common forms of modern Aranthian weaponry, check out the Armed Civilian, Law Enforcement Officer, Ilessian Regional Guard, Soldier, and SIDE Agent templates.

  **The President:** The highest-ranking person in the Ilessian Government, the President wields enormous political power, but its power is restricted by the Senate. Once elected, a President serves a single ten-year term unless removed from office by the Senate.

  The President's big power comes in the form of *executive decrees*. The grossly simplified version of this is that the President can pretty much give orders, and they must, by law, be carried out. Refusing a legal order from the President is (with certain exceptions) considered treason. However, the word *legal* is key there \- there are numerous restrictions on what sort of orders the President can actually give and to whom they can be given, most of which are applied by the Senate. Another big restriction on the power of an executive decree is that it must be a *positive* action. The President has no special legal ability to order someone *not* to do something (granted, obeying when the President tells you to stop it is good sense, but such orders don't carry legal weight). Naturally, there are some gray areas \- the President, for example, couldn't order law enforcement *not* to imprison someone, but could order them *to* release someone. The President may also countermand previous executive decrees freely.

  While there have occasionally been powerful Dreamer Presidents, it's far from required. For any who worry about their Commander-in-Chief being assaulted or afflicted by various Dreamer powers, they may rest assured that upon entering office the President receives various technological defensive and tactical measures that rival full-scale mecha, allowing the Ilessian President to enter battle as PL 15 threat if need be, to say nothing for various bodyguards, the security of the Presidential Estate and the President's personal vehicles, and of course, the threat of an Ilessian military response against anyone who dares try to attack their Commander-in-Chief with either weapons or powers. Reaching the Presidency in a world of Dreamer powers and superhuman levels of skill is a daunting task, and most Presidents can be assumed to have at least some social and knowledge skills that take full advantage of this Power Level as well.

  The current Ilessian President is Mandy Blythe, who in fact is a Dreamer, possessing the power of Compassion Inducement, and ability she oftens wishes it were legal for her to use in her job.

  **The Delegates:** One of the checks on Presidential power comes in the form of the Delegates. The Delegates are the highest-ranking members of the President's staff, each one responsible for a certain broad area of governance. The Delegates are, literally, the people that the President delegates governmental matters to. Delegates can make executive decrees just as the President can, with the following additional restrictions: the decree must be in their field, and the President must authorize them to give the decree. A Delegate only has power to act as granted by the President, who can selectively revoke a Delegate's authority at will.

  Many laws that limit the power of the President, rather than preventing a decree outright, only restrict it to being given through a Delegate. This includes most major matters of government. Thus, for the most part, the President tells the Delegates what to do, and they give the actual orders to do it. However, and this is important, Delegates themselves are *entirely immune* from executive decrees, with one exception: if a majority vote by the Senate confirms the decree, it applies to the Delegate. This means, above all, that they may refuse orders from the President freely \- and they are *expected* to do so if they feel it does not serve the national interest. Delegates also are not mere mouthpieces for the President. The President cannot dictate exact decrees to them, but only authorize them to decree certain things. This means that while they are only empowered to decree the things the President wants, they can choose the *wording* of the decree, and use their own interpretation of the President's orders.

  Delegates are appointed by the President, but once appointed, can only be removed from power by a Senate-confirmed decree from the President. The President then appoints a new Delegate at its own discretion. If a replacement has not been chosen when the original Delegate is removed from office, the Senate selects one of its number to act as a temporary Delegate in the interim. By tradition but not by law, Presidential candidates name their delegates during the election process, and voters typically take them into account when casting their vote.

  In practice, the President generally works closely with the Delegates to determine decrees so there is no conflict, with any issues hashed out beforehand. The Delegates serve primarily as an organizational tool. However, having both the power to interpret and even prevent the President's actions in their fields, and being the President's primary source for information in their fields, they each wield great political power.

  The Delegates are not the President's personal staff, who assist the President in more day-to-day matters such as scheduling events and meetings, running communications with the press (and keeping the President abreast of news and such), making sure the President doesn't forget to eat and sleep, and so on.

  While replacing Delegates is, in theory, much easier than replacing Senators and the President, actually finding one that is sufficiently knowledgeable in its field and that the President can trust and work well with isn't always the easiest task, and the loss of a Delegate can temporarily bind the President's power in important ways. As such, Delegates are furnished with sufficient technology to enter combat at PL 12\. While Delegates do not run for office directly, they are usually selected for their social savvy and knowledge in their fields, and can be expected to meet PL 12 standards in relevant areas.

  *The Delegate of Economy:* Responsible for all matters involving domestic use and acquisition of finances. Any actual expenditures of taxpayer money, or governmental actions that affect Ilessian business interests, are in the purview of the Delegate of Economy.

  *The Delegate of Environment:* Responsible for matters involving the Ilessian environment. Maintaining national parks and protected wilderness areas, approving urbanization of land, implementing regulations regarding polution and waste, and combatting natural disasters, for example.

  *The Delegate of Infrastructure:* Responsible for matters involving public works and infrastructure. Electricity, water, sewage, roads, rails, the internet, and so on.

  *The Delegate of Justice:* Responsible for matters involving civil and criminal law and the enforcement thereof. Pretty much everything in the Ilessian Law Enforcement section.

  *The Delegate of Knowledge:* Responsible for matters involving Ilessian knowledge. Education at all levels, maintaining libraries and museums, funding or otherwise incentivising scientific projects, and the like. Notably, Ilessian intelligence agencies are under the purview of the Delegate of Knowledge *not* the Delegate of War.

  *The Delegate of Law:* Responsible for matters involving the creation of law, primarily by serving as the President's main point of contact with the Senate.

  *The Delegate of State:* Responsible for general diplomatic interactions with other countries \- specifically, those that don't involve war or trade.

  *The Delegate of Public Safety:* Responsible for matters involving protection of the public from things other than *people*. So, EMTs, hospitals, firefighters, and even the ACC all fall under this Delegate.

  *The Delegate of Trade:* Responsible for trade with other countries.

  *The Delegate of War:* Responsible for all matters of war and defense of the country.

  **The Senate:** The Senate is made up of 100 people, who serve five-year terms, but can serve as many terms as they can get elected for. They are responsible for determining what is law in Ilessia. Strictly speaking, the big divide between the powers of the President and the powers of the Senate is that the President tells people *what to do*, while the Senate tells people \- up to and including the President \- what they *may not do*. Where the President makes *positive* decrees, the Senate makes *negative* laws. The Senate generally meets for three days every two weeks, spending two days in formal discussion about current items on the agenda and possible new items to add to the agenda, and the last day voting and formally proposing new items, which are then deliberated on during the off time. This schedule can be altered in cases where emergency action is called for, or an especially large agenda requires additional time be added.

  As a simple example, say that Ilessia has a billion credits in tax money that they want to use. The President is the one who actually says, "fund this, buy that" and so on, almost always through the Delegates. But the Senate writes laws saying, for example, "The President cannot spend more than 10,000,000 credits per year except through Delegates", "The President cannot spend more than 250,000,000 credits per year on military expenditures", "The President cannot send any Ilessian money to the Empire of Haptarus", "The President may not order citizens to spend money on its behalf, except through taxes, which cannot exceed..." and so on.

  While Senators do not have the same broad immunity to executive decrees that Delegates do, there are Constitutional protections for the Senate against decrees that would allow the President to influence their jobs.

  In general, a law simply requires a majority vote to pass. In the event of a tie, the Vice President casts the deciding vote. The Delegate of the field relevant to the Law, however, has a limited veto power (the President itself does *not* have veto power). If the law was not passed by at least a 67% majority, it is subject to veto. A law passed with 67% or more of the Senate vote is immune from veto.

  The Senate may also vote the President out of office, but this requires a 75% majority vote. The Senate can "vote down" executive decrees, in essence passing a law against that decree directly. With a majority vote, the decree is robbed of legal power in the future. With a 67% majority, the decree is retroactively negated, removing any legal consequences from people who might have originally refused it.

  The Senate may change or remove laws as well. The revision or removal of laws may be proposed by any Senator, with a standard majority required to amend the law, but a 67% majority required to remove or extensively change it. However, at every Senate meeting, a small number of laws are automatically brought up for review. These laws can be stricken or changed with a normal majority.

  Senate votes may only be cast at the Hall of the Senate (colloquially "the Hall"), which includes numerous safeguards to detect and prevent undue influence upon how a Senator votes (such as mind-manipulating, illusory, or shape-shifting powers), as well as robust physical defenses. Senators are provided with sufficient personal defense technology to operate at PL 10 in combat, and generally have the skills and experience to do so in more political realms as well.

  **City Government:** The highest level of city government is largely the same as federal on a smaller scale. The city has a Mayor, who has the power of executive decree within its city (but Mayoral decrees cannot run opposed to Presidential decrees), and a Council, who are basically equivalent to the mayor's Delegates, except Councilors are elected rather than appointed. Mayors serve for five-year terms and can serve up to four terms. Councilors can serve any number of terms, but each term lasts only two years. Individual cities do not have their own equivalents to Senates; generally speaking, all Ilessian cities are subject to the same laws. However, it is entirely possible for the Senate to create laws specific to individual cities. By tradition but not by law, only Senators *from* (that is, elected to a district within) a given city may propose laws specific to their city, so a city's Senators also wield impressive local power.

  After accounting for defensive tech, Mayors can generally be assumed to operate at PL 10, barring any superior personal powers, and Councilors are generally PL 8\.

  **The Ilessian Constitution:** The Constitution is a document that describes *the powers of the government*. It establishes the roles of the President, Delegates, Senate, Mayors, and Councils, describes the absolute limits of what they're capable of, and determines certain basic limits of their powers. Take it as a given that any blatantly obvious government-breaking uber-loophole that would make the entire system go crashing down into the fires of anarchy or dictatorship (like executive decrees on who to vote for or other such nonsense) are covered up somewhere in the Constitution.

  The Constitution is also a living document. The Senate can propose changes or amendments to the Constitution as with normal laws. If a Senate majority approves, the President must then decree that the people can vote on it. From there, the change is passed only if a nation-wide popular vote approves it with a 60% majority. However, the Constitution can *only* declare and restrict powers of the government. It has no basis in itself in national law.

  **Elections:** Elections in Ilessia are always by popular vote, with whichever candidate receives the most votes getting elected. Naturally, who actually gets to vote varies. Every citizen in the country may vote for the President, and every citizen of a given city can vote for that city's Mayor and Councilors. There are 100 Senate districts in the country, and any citizens living in those districts vote for that district's Senator.

  Elections are held at the same time period as terms last for (President every ten years, Mayor every five years, etc). Senatorial elections are staggered so that each year, a fifth of the districts are holding elections.

  **Political Parties:** There are five major political parties in Ilessia. Every President since they were established has been a member of one of these five parties, and *most* Senators, Mayors, and Councilors have as well, but occasionally an independent can squeak out a win in those fields. Broadly speaking, the big thing that separates the parties is their emphasis on which fields of government \- that is, which Delegates \- are the most important. The different parties are generally favored in different regions and by different major organization, but such favoritism, while statistically noticeable, isn't completely pervasive. There's generally plenty of competition among the parties throughout cities and organizations.

  *The Builders:* Most Important: Infrastructure, Knowledge. Least Important: Environment, Public Safety. Favored In: Lastelle. Favored By: IDEA.  
  The Builders are all about creating a better, more efficient, and more advanced society. They have a heavy emphasis on public works, scientific progress, and identifying and solving problems. Currently, the party's driving goal is winning the "Portal Race" (both Ilessian and Limbran scientists are trying to be the first to develop a stable country-wide portal network that can be maintained for high-volume travel without Dreamtech or at least with a reasonable energy cost \- neither are anywhere close but the Builders want way more resources to be dedicated to it). They have taken some licks on environmental matters, as they don't have all that many qualms about sacrificing the environment for efficient infrastructure. They have also caught quite a bit of flak for supporting innovation even despite risks. In the political arena, it's often said that for every IDEA experiment gone wrong, there's a Builder writing the check that funds it. Currently, the Builders hold 24 Senate seats.

  *The Defenders:* Most Important: Justice, War. Least Important: Law, Trade. Favored In: Adaros. Favored By: SIDE.  
  The Defenders are all about the protection of Ilessia and its people from threats both internal and external. They strongly lobby for sending more forces into Indelar to end the threat of Haptarus before it becomes a global one, and call for extensive justice system reform to emphasize punishment and deterrence as much as rehabilitation. They are also outspoken proponents of allowing the military more leeway in engaging Ilessian threats and providing combat support to law enforcement, and would really, really like to see a government-run alternative to Hero Corps. They favor less governmental restriction in general, especially in the area of trade, which they see as better handled by the private sector. Currently, the Defenders hold 20 Senate seats.

  *The Leaders:* Most Important: Economy, Law. Least Important: Justice, Infrastructure. Favored In: Arbera. Favored By: The Assembly of Dreams.  
  The Leaders are bureaucrats extraordinaire. Their whole thing is making the *system* work as well as possible, making sure funds get where they need to go, the laws are fair, practical, and sufficiently thorough, and making sure the government has the power and the resources to quickly respond to and deal with any problems or emergencies that might come up. The party is currently focusing a lot of their attention on finding a solution for the fact that between technological automation and Dreamers in the workforce, large companies are offering fewer jobs than ever before, resulting in huge swaths of the population working in energy farms, without hampering the competitive edge *of* those Ilessian businesses. The Leaders tend to focus on things they feel need *fixing* rather than tinkering with stuff that works, and they feel that the Ilessian justice system and infrastructure are solidly in the latter category, so they don't emphasize them much. Currently, the Leaders hold 17 Senate seats.

  *The Neighbors:* Most Important: State, Trade. Least Important: Economy, War. Favored In: Verdania. Favored By: Big Dreams, Inc.  
  The Neighbors place the greatest emphasis of all the political parties on foreign affairs, particularly wanting to emphasize Ilessia's role as a major power and leader in the global community. Currently, their big goal as a party is trying to work out some means of engaging Haptarus diplomatically to negotiate an end to their war of conquest in Indelar. So, you know, wish them luck on that\! The Neighbors feel the job of the government is to *bring in* money and resources for the country and its people through trade, not to *spend* money and resources where it doesn't have to be, so they favor a light-touch approach to government spending and business regulation, as well as tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts. They also believe that Ilessia spends way more on its military than is anywhere near necessary (that money could be going to more important things\! Like tax cuts\!) and that interactions with other nations should always be diplomatic ones. Currently, the Neighbors hold 22 Senate seats, and President Mandy Blythe is a member of the Neighbors party.

  *The Preservers:* Most Important: Environment, Public Safety. Least Important: State, Knowledge. Favored In: Estruan. Favored By: The Reclaimers.  
  The Preservers are a more conservative party that emphasizes general comfort, health, and safety of Ilessian people. They emphasize a far-sighted view of environmental protections and improvements and strong funding for emergency services and disaster relief. One of their major goals at the moment is to fund a massive mission to launch every bit of radioactive waste the country has generated into space (the waste is currently safely stored in sealed underground disposal sites, but especially after seeing what happened to the Braizen Isles, they are not convinced that's enough). They are much more focused on domestic matters than interactions with other countries, and tend to be conservative regarding scientific advancement, especially of riskier kinds. Currently, the Preservers hold 17 Senate seats.

  **Dreamers and Government:** Dreamers are free to take part in Ilessian government, and have no special restrictions in doing so. Naturally, using Dreamer powers to *influence* governmental procedure, in addition to being quite difficult (most government buildings have specialized nullifiers to prevent things like mind control, mind reading, shape changing, and so on), is *hideously* illegal. That said, many Dreamers use their powers as a selling point in their campaigns \- there's a Senator with a high level of Mental Quickness who ran on a platform of personally reviewing and responding to all communications from people in his district, for example, and while President Blythe can't actually legally use her Compassion Inducement powers in matters of government, it sure *sounded* good to voters that their leader's power was all about making people nicer.

  **Ilessian Military**

  **The Army:** The Army is the largest of the three main Forces of the Ilessian military, and the most active currently. It consists primarily of ground forces, although the Army does use flying vehicles for transport. The Army in its modern incarnation is meant as a *defensive* Force more than an offensive one, intended primarily to neutralize threats against Ilessian territories and interests. They specialize in securing and holding terrain, and emphasize teamwork and defensive tactics. The "ground force" of well-trained, well-equipped soldiers (PL 5\) are backed up by four armored divisions \- the Light Infantry (soldiers in suits of lighter, faster powered armor; PL 8), the Heavy Infantry (soldiers in heavier, more expensive powered armor; PL 10), the Light Cavalry (PL 10 Aerial Combat Vehicles), and the Heavy Cavalry (PL 12 Hovertanks). The Army makes extensive use of artillery emplacements (Movable Installations that have high-range, high-point-value offensive powers, typically at PL 12\) to secure territory and neutralize foes before they become a threat. The most powerful weapons in the Army's arsenal are mecha \- enormous humanoid robots piloted by some of the best fighters in the Army. Mecha are designed with cutting-edge neural link technology, allowing the pilot to move in them as fluidly as in their own bodies, allowing all their skill and natural physical prowess to translate \- at a vastly augmented scale \- to the mech. More importantly, the humanoid form allows the mech to conduct energy in the same way as the human body does, which combined with the linking technology allows the pilot's Spiritual Energy to help power and further augment the mech \- which, among other things, means a Dreamer mecha pilot can channel its powers through the mech, augmenting them thereby.

  While much of the Army is on passive duty in Ilessia, guarding military bases, the border with Limbra, and so on, a sizable chunk is on active duty in Indelar, helping to defend the borders of the various Indelan nations from Haptarus.

  **The Navy:** While they may not be the fastest means of transport, even in the modern age, ships are one of the most cost-effective means of transporting goods in bulk. The Ilessian Navy defends Ilessian waters, and Ilessian ships in international waters, serving as a powerful deterrent to pirates. Naturally, there are strict international laws against military ships entering another country's waters, so trade ships have to leave their naval protection behind when they do so. Just as naturally, the Ilessian Navy has outfitted their ships with sufficiently powerful weaponry to wage an effective battle from well outside that radius.

  The Navy is in some ways both the strongest and the weakest of the three Forces. Ilessia has never had anything more than minor skirmishes with most of the nations that the Navy would primarily defend them from (if war were to break out again between Ilessia and Limbra, the Army would be far more important to it, and Haptarus being in the center of Indelar, is largely beyond the Navy's range of engagement). As a result, when money gets cut from the military, the Navy is usually more adversely affected.

  That being said, the Navy has some of the most powerful weaponry in the entirely military. Naval sailors are generally trained more for shipboard operations than combat, and not as personally well equipped as their Army counterparts (PL 4). They make up for it, however, as ships can easily fit what are normally artillery emplacements as primary weapons, giving them extreme offensive range and power. The main classes of Navy ships are Cutters (PL 8), Destroyers (PL 10), Battleships (PL 12), and Carriers (PL 15).

  But the most devastating weapon in the Navy's arsenal \- and, for that matter, the Ilessian military as a whole \- is the nuclear missile. How do you build a nuke mechanically. Take a PL 15 character. Spend every point it's got on Equipment. Spend every EP on a single rank 15 attack with a huge range, huge area, and generally a Linked effect or two. And do not so much as *glance* in the direction of the Selective Extra.

  **The Air Force:** If the Army is the most "defensive" of the three Forces, the Air Force is the most "offensive". While the Army and Navy have planes and flying vehicles as well, the Air Force has the best and the most. The Air Force plays only a minor role in the war in Indelar, flying occasional combat or bombing runs against Haptaran targets when necessary to support the Army, but so far the Ilessian military is hesitant to commit to an outright offensive war against the Empire.

  Like sailors, most Air Force pilots have less training and gear for personal combat than Army soldiers (PL 4), but that hardly matters when they're usually flying war planes. Most war planes count as PL 12 threats, although different ones have different specialties. The Air Force is also the only military branch that goes into space regularly, and they are capable of engaging in an orbital battle with their starfighters.

  The Air Force's Big Gun is the Kill Sat, a satellite armed with devastating orbital bombardment weaponry. Although it does have kinetic impact weapon capable of causing wide-area devastation, Kill Sats generally rely on extremely high-powered energy discharge weapons that affect a relatively focused area. They're generally used to obliterate a building and everyone in it. Kill Sats operate at PL 15, but most of their attacks are Rank 20 Targeted Area effects \- and being up in orbit, they usually have no qualms about All Out Attacking.

  **Special Forces:** Special Forces are always tied to one of the three main Forces. They're elite units that tend to run missions where a small, well-trained squad would be more effective or appropriate than a major military assault. Your typical Special Forces operative is a PL 6-7 badass by virtue of skill and gear alone \- but they can rank quite a bit higher with the addition of accumulated experience, powered armor, cutting-edge weaponry, or Dreamer powers. Some well-known Special Forces operations include:

  *OUT-SIDE:* The military arm of SIDE is officially a Special Forces division tied to the Army. OUT-SIDE is the largest Special Forces division, but their size doesn't restrict their skill \- their soldiers operate at PL 8 at the minimum, and some OUT-SIDE soldiers have been known to push to PL 10 on skill alone. They also have access to PL 10 and PL 12 suits of powered armor. OUT-SIDE specializes in dealing with situations involving enemy Dreamers, and are well-equipped to detect and disable Dreamer threats.

  *Dream Teams:* The military has a few "Dream Teams" spread throughout the Forces; small groups of generally 4-6 Dreamers, typically at PL 10, with extensive military training and synergistic powers. A lot of Dream Team operatives are actually kinda "weak" in terms of raw Dreamer power \- it's their training, tactics, and, above all, teamwork more than their personal power that makes them deadly.

  *Armored Division Elite (ADE):* An Army Special Forces team consisting of some of the finest power-armored soldiers in the country, equipped with top-of-the-line, absolutely bleeding-edge powered armor (PL 12). ADE is sent in when both extreme power and extreme precision are required, but subtlety is not an issue.

  *The Wetworks:* A Navy Special Forces team, the Wetworks are all about stealth. Trained and equipped for amphibious infiltration, they are typically used to swiftly and silently take over enemy ships, but have also been used in the past for purposes of spying and assassination. They travel light, but their stealth suits and weaponry use cutting-edge tech that lets them operate at PL 10\. They are also known to be masters of stealth, to the point that they have been known to slip by even high-tech cameras and Dreamer powers. The government of Ilessia cannot confirm or deny that they have successfully infiltrated Paradisia.

  *Alpha Storm:* An Air Force Special Forces team, and widely agreed to be the most overconfident, arrogant, over-the-top, glory-hounding group in the entire military. Their motto is "Strike like lightning", and to be entirely fair, that is absolutely what they do. Equipped with cutting-edge suits of light powered armor (PL 10\) designed to withstand high-velocity impacts and built for extreme speed, their primary strategy is to take a space flight way, way over their target, and drop on them with all the speed that gravity and their own thrusters will allow (this means of deployment serves an important purposes \- by coming in at speed from space, they cross borders from out of range of most border defense systems). Their impacts can smash through fortifications, kill single targets, and cause weak shockwaves that can stun those nearby. From there, they proceed to wage a rapid assault to neutralize threats, achieve their mission parameters, and get gone at speed. They boast that they usually complete their mission before the sonic boom of their arrival reaches the ground.

  **Spies:** Spies are military assets, but the operate outside of military command structure (even up to the Delegate level \- they answer to the Delegate of Knowledge rather than the Delegate of War). Ilessian spies work in the Ilessian Intelligence Network. Many spies are simply watchers and analysis with only limited combat training and eschewing military technology (as it tends to draw attention), and operate as low as PL 2\. However, there are plenty of elite spies out there, including former Special Forces operatives, who can act at a much higher PL. IN-SIDE operates as part of the IIN, and as with IN-SIDE's role in the rest of SIDE, the IIN is responsible for internal affairs and investigations of law enforcement, government, and military personnel.

  **Military Regulations:** By law, the military is largely prohibited from acting against Ilessian citizens. That is to say, they can't serve in a law enforcement, crowd control, or similar capacity where they would be dealing primarily with Ilessians. They *are* empowered to defend Ilessia against foreign attack, up to and including defending individual Ilessian citizens from individual foreign agents. They are free to secure their bases and other holdings even against Ilessians, and may use lethal force if necessary to ensure their security. Finally, taking a cue from Hero Corps, the military is legally allowed to respond to attacks upon government officials, or the families of government, law enforcement, or military personnel, even when the attack was initiated by Ilessian citizens.

  **SIDE's Role in the Military:** OUT-SIDE is a special forces team attached to the Army, and IN-SIDE is part of the IIN. Both factions serve as dedicated groups for dealing with Dreamers and Dreamer-related matters in their respective fields. OUT-SIDE, for example, is equipped with Dreamer detection and neutralization technology in addition to standard military gear, and trained to combat enemy military Dreamers. It's important to bear in mind that SIDE is only a small part of the military; OUT-SIDE makes up maybe 5% of all special forces units, and well less than 1% of the total Ilessian military. IN-SIDE accounts for maybe 2% of the IIN.

  **Dreamers and the Military:** Ilessia eagerly welcomes any Dreamers who wish to serve in a military capacity, but do not require such service from their Dreamers. There are several incentives, but Dreamers make up only a small portion of Ilessia's military, as relatively few wish to take on the risk, and most can get far better benefits in the private sector. Even then, most of the Dreamers in the military are considered reservists \- they are willing to be called in by the military for certain tasks, but don't work for it full-time. The Ilessian military is very good at teaching their Dreamers to get the most out of their powers; the majority of Ilessian military Dreamers don't have amazing raw power, but with training and tactics, are able to use what they have to very impressive effect.

  **Dreamers vs. the Military:** In a lot of superhero worlds, the superheroes are the big guns and the military is lucky to be even vaguely relevant. This is not the case on Aranth. While your average soldier is no match for a Hero-level Dreamer, a soldier in modern powered armor, or a well-piloted ACV, could give one a fair fight. Even experienced Heroes and other Dreamers of power would find a hovertank, fighter jet, or naval destroyer to be a credible challenge, as they would the cutting-edge powered armor that some high-ranking officers use when they take to the front lines. Even the most powerful Dreamers should think carefully before battling something like a mech or carrier in open combat.

  It's also worth noting that even among combat-capable Dreamers, many of them have combat powers equivalent to professional-grade weaponry (roughly 3 PP/PL). Most military-grade weapons clock in at 4 PP/PL.

  This is not to say that in any matchup of Dreamer vs. Military, the Dreamer loses. Dreamers in particular have access to specialized capabilities that the military can't easily emulate. The military also needs time to gear up and send orders down the chain of command, and of course, is subject to legal prohibitions restricting what sort of battles they can involve themselves in. However, in terms of open combat, the military has no problem whatsoever keeping up with \- and often exceeding \- the fighting power of Dreamers.  
  A role playing game is three things. It is an interactive story, a game of chance, and a process in critical thinking.

  If brevity is the soul of wit, I'm witty like a vampire\!

  **Ilessian Law Enforcement**

  **Local Police:** Local police are the backbone of Ilessian law enforcement. Police offers are employed by individual cities, and have jurisdiction throughout their city. Outside of their own cities, police have roughly the same level of legal authority as members of Hero Corps. Police are *not* primarily combat units. They're trained to defend themselves and others, of course, and your average police officer is more than a match for your average punk criminal, but their role is primarily investigation, apprehension, and general public safety. Most police officers are PL 3, with "professional grade" weapons (generally valued at 3 PP/rank, compared to the typical 4/rank of military-grade weapons or 2/rank of civilian-grade weapons).

  **Regional Guards:** The Ilessian Guard occupies a special niche in the law enforcement arena. The Guard is employed by the Big Five cities, and have jurisdiction throughout their region. They primarily work cases that go between cities in their region, but tend to serve more as coordinators than lead investigators, ensuring that the police of all cities involved are sharing information, smoothing over jurisdictional issues, and so on. They also serve as mediators between the local police and the national Watch, or other governmental agencies, such as SIDE or the IIN. The Guard have a reputation for calm, unshakable patience. They are quite adept at mediating between various law enforcement branches, and are sometimes called in to coax information from reticent suspects or witnesses.

  Aside from their role as mediators, though, the Guard is the primary combat arm of Ilessian law enforcement, fulfilling roles largely similar to state militias, the National Guard, and SWAT. The Guard as an organization doesn't have the same resources as any branch of the military, but individual guards are as well-trained and well-equipped as any soldier (PL 5, military-grade weapons). The Guard favors nonlethal weaponry, but they have access to lethal weapons when they are required. They also have access to light ACVs and light suits of powered armor, both of which they can field as PL 8 threats. When law enforcement needs to deal with well-armed criminals, hostage situations, and the like, they call in the Guard \- who, conveniently, also have the psychological training to sometimes talk such threats down without resorting to violence.

  **The National Watch:** Federal crimes are investigated by the National Watch, whose jurisdiction extends throughout Ilessia. They're basically the Ilessian equivalent of the USA's FBI. There is some tension between the National Watch and local police, but the Regional Guards are usually able to keep things running smoothly. It's worth noting that the National Watch are, in general, not big fans of Hero Corps, Registered Independents, the Sentinel Project, or other operations where civilians take on a law enforcement role. Such individuals should expect bureaucratic impediment when their activities cause them to cross paths with the Watch.

  Like the police, the Watch is not primarily a combat arm, turning to the Guard when serious fighting power is required. That said, they have a federal budget, so they have somewhat better tech and training than most police (PL 4, professional-grade weaponry).

  **Ilessian Courts:** The courts in Ilessia are purely a law enforcement organization, with no role in the creation of laws. Ilessia does *not* use a Common Law system \- judges are empowered to *interpret* the law where it may be unclear, and may use their own sense to determine whether the facts of a case fit a certain law, but the rulings of one judge have no direct influence on the rulings of another or the legal system as a whole. However, especially in major cases, a judge's interpretation may inspire the Senate to clarify or revise a law.

  Many civil and criminal cases are settled out of court through negotiations among lawyers, although a judge has to sign off on the settlement. Outside of settlements, civil trials are always argued before a single judge, as are minor criminal trials (misdemeanors, pretty much). For major criminal cases, the defendant may choose one of three options: a bench trial (single judge), a tribunal trial (three judges, majority decision required), or a jury trial (ten random people, unanimous decision required to convict, majority to acquit). If a given trial does not result in a decision, a different structure is used for the next trial (if you get a hung jury, for example, the retrial is either bench or tribunal). If all three structures go through without a solid decision \- which is *very* rare \- the case is ended as an acquittal.

  Criminal cases are prosecuted either locally (city-scale) or federally (nation-scale). There aren't region-scale cases. Small towns and villages usually have individual judges for civil and minor criminal cases, but major criminal cases are prosecuted at the nearest large city, to allow for a broader roster of judges. Generally speaking, only experienced judges with proven records are allowed to sit major bench trials, to minimize the possibility of corruption or human error.

  In general, a bench case is what you want when you want a single, highly experienced, intelligent legal professional looking over the facts and making a decision. Bench cases weigh extremely heavily on a judge's professional record, so there is extreme pressure to make sure they get it right. Bench judges tend to be difficult to manipulate and highly resistant to tactics of social influence. That being said, it means putting your fate into a single person's hands. The most experienced lawyers, capable of making their own unbiased review of the case, will generally suggest a bench trial when they are 100% convinced that their client is innocent. Less experienced lawyers...are more wary about it. Oftentimes, opting for a bench trial can lead to a settlement, as putting everything in the hands of a single, experienced judge is generally taken as a sign of high confidence. Naturally, no system is 100% perfect, and lawyers advise avoiding a bench trial if any of the bench judges in the area have a reputation for corruption or (more likely) being especially hard on certain types of defendants or cases. For example, a good lawyer would advise against a bench case for a Dreamer client if any of the judges in the area have strong Reclaimer leanings. There may be only a one-in-ten shot of actually getting that judge, and even then, the seriousness of a bench trial may outweigh the judge's personal feelings 99% of the time, but that one-in-a-thousand chance of it going wrong isn't worth it.

  Tribunal trials tend to be favored by defendants who want to prove a point. Getting two out of three qualified judges to agree with you can be huge, especially for someone who has already been raked across the coals in the court of public opinion. And of course, a unanimous verdict from a tribunal can carry huge weight. Tribunals are also widely considered the most precise form of trial \- the judges will deliberate among themselves before rendering a verdict, so they each cover any blind spots the others might have, but they're all experienced professionals who know the law thoroughly and aren't going to be easily manipulated. Less experienced lawyers will often favor tribunals over juries when up against more skilled attorneys, since sheer eloquence is less of a factor than simply being right.

  Jury trials are generally considered the least precise from a legal standpoint \- after all, juries are random people, not trained professionals. They tend to be the most prone to being decided on the sheer charisma of the lawyers and witnesses, or how sympathetic the defendant or victims are. They are also usually the longest form of trial, because jurors are *heartily encouraged* to ask their own questions (although lawyers may, of course, object to any juror question that is not relevant to the case). That being said, they make it very hard for a defendant to be wrongfully convicted. When the facts of the case might give you trouble but you have a slick attorney and a handful of well-spoken experts in your pocket, a jury trial is hard to beat for purposes of maximizing your change of an acquittal. That being said, ten people mean ten places for ideas and realizations to come from. Juries have more game than they sometimes get credit for.

  Criminal cases are judged in three areas \- on the facts, on the merits, and on the law. Acquittal in any area results in an acquittal, although it's possible for one area (typically merits) to mitigate a conviction \- the defendant is convicted, but generally receives lighter sentencing due to mitigating circumstances.

  The facts are the hard facts of the case, in short "did this person commit this crime". A conviction by the facts is the most important area of the case, and *is always potentially subject to review*. Double Jeopardy exists, but only applies to people convicted on the facts but acquitted on the law and/or the merits (basically, they can't be tried again if the law changes, if someone made a legal error, or by different people who might take a different view of the case). If a defendant is acquitted on the facts, and new evidence is brought to light indicating they did in fact commit the crime, they can be retried. However, a retrial must first unanimously pass a tribunal confirming that the new evidence is even sufficient to allow retrial, before the actual trial even has a chance to take place, so it's not the easiest thing. Likewise, if new facts are brought to light exonerating a person, they are rapidly cleared of prior charges and released. This sort of thing can be absolutely *devastating* to the careers of investigators, attorneys, and judges involved \- convicting the wrong person of a crime is pretty much the biggest legal failure there is.

  The merits are the circumstances of the case. Generally speaking, merits are going to modify a conviction on the facts, leading to reduced (or sometimes, more severe) punishments. However, it is possible to be convicted on the facts but acquitted on the merits. Judges tend to be unlikely to entirely acquit on merits (but it can happen), but juries do so often enough, especially for very sympathetic defendants. It's worth noting that unless there's a strong reason like self defense, being convicted on the facts but acquitted on the merits can still be socially debilitating, carrying a stigma of being guilty of the crime, but having gotten away with it by putting on a good show. This is doubly true for jury trials.

  The law is about, well, whether or not the action being prosecuted is actually against the law. Ideally, this means areas like self-defense, or other areas where the law provides clear-cut situations where what is ordinarily a crime is allowed. By and large, the Senate tries to keep the law up to date, relatively easy to parse, and relatively free of loopholes \- but no system is perfect, and in some cases where the law doesn't quite fit, an acquittal by the law may occur when even the facts and the merits of the case would convict. Outside of the clear-cut by-the-law situations, most acquittals by the law come from judge interpretations of a vague or tangential law.

  Importantly, the law enforcement *process* generally does *not* influence prosecution. Violations of rights do *not* result in evidence being deemed inadmissible, so long as the evidence itself is trustworthy (a coerced confession will be thrown out, for example). However, these violations are, themselves, *major crimes*. Law enforcement officials who resort to illegal searches, invasions of privacy, torture, coercion, and so on may count themselves *lucky* if all they lose is their jobs (*especially* if it turns out the person whose rights they were violating were actually innocent \- a cowboy cop might get away with it for a time if they keep bringing in really, really nasty bad guys, but once they violate the rights of a more sympathetic criminal or an actual innocent, they are in for a whole heap of trouble). These sorts of activities are regarded by law enforcement as a whole as equivalent to things like jury tampering, witness intimidation or killing, and so on \- all of which are extremely thoroughly investigated and come with severe sentences. If a key witness dies before they can testify, you can bet that it will strongly negatively influence the defendant's case unless they can prove they truly had nothing to do with it.

  This feeds into the salient goal of the Ilessian justice system \- its purpose is to *get to the truth* so the laws can be fairly and correctly applied. The system does err on the side of acquittal, because punishing the innocent is considered far worse than letting the guilty go (which is why the defendant gets to choose the trial structure, and why jury trials are largely defense-favorable), but the system is designed at its core to find the truth. This influences several key aspects of the system, a big one being, the assumption is not innocent until proven guilty. The assumption is, "we have no assumption, but we are going to *find out*".

  This also influences the role lawyers play in the system. Attorney-client privilege *does not apply towards the courts*. What you tell a lawyer, the lawyer cannot reveal to the press, to business rivals, etc. But they are legally required to divulge information they learn that is relevant to getting to the truth. An attorney who knows or believes their client to be guilty is not expected to try and trick the courts into getting them off \- and lawyers lose a *lot* of professional respect if it's found that they are doing so. Defendants have the right to not self-incriminate of course, and defense attorneys are generally supposed to take their clients at their word (it's their job to be on the lookout for the information that can exonerate them, even when the prosecution's case seems ironclad), but if it's obvious that the client is guilty, the defense attorney's job becomes advising them to come clean and assisting them in getting a fair deal for doing so.

  Similarly, court cases, while not the fastest things in the world, are reasonably efficient. An army of lawyers with an unlimited budget can't bury their opponents in motions. Opposing counsel, judges, and jurors are all entitled to tell them to get to their point in a timely manner. Most lawyers, in fact, have fairly reasonable rates, and while having a lawyer is strongly advised, it's more for their experience and debating skill than because they're necessary to navigate the legal system. In fact, most lawyers have fairly reasonable rates, and your average Ilessian court case is based largely on the facts, influenced a bit by attorney charisma and so on.

  *However*, for those with the money or the connections, it is extremely possible to operate outside the system to gain an advantage. The Assembly of Dreams in particular are quiet masters of exploiting these options. The main ways of doing this are:

  *Expensive Lawyers:* There are some lawyers out there who "go beyond the call of duty" as they like to put it. The best of them are simply very, very good at what they do \- they are smart, they are slick, they have very high social skills, and they will have a jury eating out of their hands, manipulate opposing counsel into accepting advantageous settlements or simply making mistakes, and may even have enough savvy to sway the opinions of a judge. The worst of them will exploit every dirty trick in the book to get their client off, including withholding information or lying outright to the court, caring for wealth and reputation for victory over professional status. The worst of the worst are both, combining a willingness to break the rules with sufficient social acumen to avoid getting caught.

  *Media Campaigns:* A well-run media campaign can influence a trial, pushing jurors in a certain direction, smearing opposing witnesses or counsel, and so on. It's expensive, and not completely reliable (there are safeguards like jury sequestering in play to help prevent these things), but it can work.

  *Working the Government:* With enough wealth and influence, it's possible to lobby the Senate to pass an advantageous law, if one can conceal one's intentions. Likewise, in local cases, a mayoral pardon can sometimes be acquired with enough money or the right words spoken in the right ears.

  *Bribery:* Naturally, bribery is severely prosecuted when discovered...but first it has to be discovered. Some prosecutors may be incorruptible, but there are plenty out there who can be convinced to make a favorable settlement for the right price.

  **Hero Corps' Role in Law Enforcement:** Hero Corps is *not* a law enforcement organization \- they are an emergency team, a group dedicated to first-response intervention in dangerous situations. They do have certain legal protections, and in many cases, law enforcement officials happily accept their help. But they have no law enforcement authority in and of themselves \- their role is ending dangerous situations, not arresting criminals or investigating crimes. Some Heroes, especially in areas where Heroes are not on as friendly terms with law enforcement (or when they step on the toes of the National Watch) can get into fairly serious hot water if they cross the line between responding to danger, and trying to hunt down criminals.

  Heroes tend to cluster around PL 10 (figure roughly half of all Heroes are PL 10, and the overwhelming majority of the rest range from PL 8 to 12). Most Heroes have combat powers equivalent to professional-grade weaponry. The real strength of Hero Corps, though, is not in its numbers, or its raw fighting power \- it's in its members diversity, their speed of response, and above all, their will and proven ability to overcome even seemingly overwhelming odds.

  **SIDE's Role in Law Enforcement:** FIRE-SIDE is the primary law-enforcement arm of SIDE. They aren't the primary law enforcement body of Ilessia by any means. On average, there's maybe one SIDE agent per hundred police officers \- much like how Dreamers make up roughly one percent of the population. They deal with Dreamer-related crimes. If Dreamers aren't involved, neither is SIDE.

  SIDE deals with Dreamer-related crimes, and that means elite training, top of the line weaponry, and a strong tactical acumen. SIDE has to be able to deal with people with superhuman powers, which means that even though law enforcement is their main deal, they have to be beyond competent in a fight. SIDE is also *all about* overwhelming force. Typical SIDE units are as follows:

  *SIDE Patrol Team:* Four SIDE agents equipped with cutting-edge weapons and armor (PL 6 each). As the name implies, typical units on active patrol, guard, and recon duty. Typically sent out to apprehend low-powered or non-combat Dreamers (generally PL 6 or less; SIDE doesn't like to play fair). SIDE agents can all be expected to have fully PL-appropriate stats, personal power nullifiers, access to military-grade weapons, and access to Analytical Detect (Dreamer Powers) technology \- meaning they'll know a target's exact powers on sight. If they know what they're up against and have time to prepare, there is a very high chance that they can get access to technology that is particularly effective against their target.

  *SIDE Assault Team:* Six SIDE agents, led by a single sergeant in a modern suit of military-grade powered armor (PL 10). This is the typical force that SIDE sends out to handle something remotely serious; small groups of weaker Dreamers, or individual Dreamers up to PL 10\. The suits have a modular design, so specialized weapons or devices appropriate to a specific target may also be incorporated if they have time to prepare and foreknowledge of their foe.

  *SIDE Combat Unit:* Two teams of four agents each, with each team led by a power-armored sergeant. Each team travels in an ACV (Aerial Combat Vehicle); flying cars with heavy armor and weapons, high speed (Flight 6; 120 MPH), and excellent maneuverability. They serve as armored platforms for the agents, rapid transport, and can engage super-powered threats as PL 10 combatants in their own right. In many cases, the vehicles are driven by Dreamers with some sort of tactical or support power (typically PL 6-8). This is what groups of Dreamers, or high-powered Dreamers (PL 10+) can expect if SIDE is making a dedicated effort to bring them in.

  *SIDE Battle Squadron:* Four to six full Combat Units, backed by one to four Dreamers with various combat, tactical, or support powers (PL typically 8-10, rarely 11-12), and led by a lieutenant in cutting-edge Dreamtech powered armor (PL 12). Resources of this level are generally only available in major cities (i.e. one of the Big Five), and are rolled out for large-scale threats.

  **The Sentinel Project's Role in Law Enforcement:** The Sentinel Project is really just a neighborhood watch organization on steroids. That being said, they're pretty good at what they do, and extremely determined. Your average Sentinel is PL 4, and has access to professional-grade weaponry, although elites with higher-tech gear can hit PL 6\. Some Sentinels are lucky enough to have old-model powered armor (PL 8). They really shouldn't, but it is possible for some Sentinel groups to get their hands on military-grade weaponry, or possibly even more modern suits of powered armor (PL 10), but these are rare.

  **Dreamers and Law Enforcement:** Dreamers are just as eagerly accepted into law enforcement as the military \- although granted, more on the combative end. Investigative Dreamer powers are...tricky to work with. Heavy Reclaimer lobbying has left many easy case-solving powers, such as mind-reading, mind control, divinations, scrying, precognition, postcognition, and so on, virtually useless in law enforcement. Partially, this is because they are usually violations of civil rights, but that can be dealt with via warrants. However, most of them are also considered actually inadmissible on the grounds of trustworthiness \- you can't guarantee that a mind reader or precog is being honest. This is one area where Reclaimer lobbying really scores points, in large part because the Assembly doesn't seem to oppose such laws with as much fervor as they have other ones, so thus far the laws largely stand. That said, with warrants or in exigent circumstances, such powers are eagerly put to use to do things like locate kidnapping victims or the like, or to give police a trail to where they might find more admissible evidence.

  **Dreamers vs. Law Enforcement:** In most cases, serious Dreamers can take on most law enforcement groups and expect to win unless overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Standard police or Watch teams might be able to take down a weak combat-capable Dreamer, but will generally lose against anything in the vicinity of Hero-level. Regional Guard teams and Sentinel groups can potentially engage Hero-level Dreamers, but not reliably, and usually not without casualty \- although Sentinels can sometimes pull out a victory against an overpowering foe just by being willing to go that extra mile. Naturally, Hero Corps can tangle with Dreamers on even keel. SIDE will usually be able to beat all but the most overwhelming of Dreamer threats, provided they A) know what they're up against, B) have enough resources in the area to field a sufficient threat, and C) have enough time to gear up and get there. This is the big reason SIDE and Hero Corps really works well together though \- Heroes can bring a lot of power to bear quickly to deal with emergencies, but when it comes to hunting down and taking in recurring villains? SIDE can bring brutally overwhelming force.

  **The Ilessian Justice System**

  The Ilessian penal system is designed around three main goals, in descending order of importance:

  1\) To keep society safe by keeping dangerous or harmful people away from others.  
  2\) To rehabilitate criminals so that they do not turn to crime in the future, and can thus reenter society without *being* a threat to others.  
  3\) To serve as a *deterrent* to crime by presenting the threat of punishment.

  **Societal Debt:** Societal debt is the primary form of penalty for crimes that are primarily material or financial in nature, as well as part of the penalty assessed for crimes committed for financial purposes. "Crime doesn't pay" as an explicit function of the justice system, pretty much. Put simply, as a result of the crime, the criminal owes society a certain amount of money. Major financial crimes may also carry prison time.

  The amount is generally based on the financial weight of the crime committed. In general, the amount of debt accrued is 120% of the value of whatever was lost/stolen/destroyed/acquired in payment for the crime/etc. Judges may assess higher penalties in special circumstances, although these rarely go above 200% of the value and never above 300%.

  Societal debt is paid to the Ilessian government directly, equivalent to tax income, but the government also carries the responsibility for reimbursing citizens who lost income or property to crime. That being said, the government is not required to make an exact repayment if it can repair the loss at a lower cost. Likewise, such reparations may sometimes be settled through payment plans, tax deductions, or similar means.

  Societal debt is not required to be paid immediately. When assessing societal debt, judges also determine what percent of the convict's income must go towards paying it each month. This counts as a tax, which does entail certain legal limits on what can be charged (there is a certain minimum income that citizens cannot be taxed below, for example). Of course, a convict can pay off its debt faster if desired. In most cases, minimum payments will be deducted automatically from the convict's accounts, and the government can seize assets if necessary to pay off societal debt. When a convict fails to make payments despite these options, it may be sentenced to prison.

  Income earned by the government through societal debt is legally limited in what it can be used for \- primarily, it is for reinbursing victims of crime, for disaster relief or humanitarian aid, or for emergency expenditures. It is prohibited from being used as payment for any government employee or funding for any government project. This is in an effort to prevent anyone from having a financial stake in increasing the amount of crime in the country or unjustly taxing criminals.

  **Prison Terms:** First, let's make absolutely clear that Ilessian prisons are "not that bad". They're not *fun* by any means, but the main "punishment" aspect of prison is that your life is on hold and you have little-to-no freedoms or luxuries. It's the adult version of time out, pretty much. But as much care is taken to ensure the safety and security of the prisoners as is taken to prevent escapes. While this doesn't make it *impossible* for a prisoner to be injured, sexually assaulted, or even killed, such events are rare and taken extremely seriously.

  Part of what makes this possible is that roughly 75% of the prison staff are robots. While human guards can take control of or communicate through the robots, they have limited access, primarily for making complex decisions. Actions are logged and subject to review, to prevent corruption. The robots are programmed to follow prison protocols, and are robust enough that they can fairly trivially neutralize prisoners without permanent harm without being subject to much risk themselves. This helps foster a non-hostile relationship between the prisoners and the guards, as the latter are rarely in close contact with the former and thus have little need to fear for their safety, nor ability to abuse their authority.

  Prisons are not uncomfortable, but they aren't anything close to nice. Cells are clean and private (with regards to other prisoners; they are remotely monitored with surveillance technology 24/7 from multiple angles), kept at a reasonable temperature, and usually around 50 square feet, but they are pretty much limited to a cot with minimal bedding, a toilet, and a sink. Prisoners receive sufficient and nutritious food, but it's pretty much bland and what they serve is what you get. There are entertainment options available, but access to them is not in prisoner control, you just get what they give you on any given day. And so on.

  Each cell has a touch-screen computer interface installed. Primarily, this interface is used by prison authorities for communication with the prisoner, and also allows prisoners to take notes or send communications both internally and externally (all of which are monitored and reviewed by prison staff; they aren't real-time). The interfaces also allow access to approved news feeds and educational reading.

  However, good behavior, assisting law enforcement or prison authorities, and similar things can earn prisoners additional luxuries. This can range from better food, to more choice in entertainment, to more visitation days, to more in-cell functionality for their interfaces (such as access to fiction books, television shows, movies, music, and websites), and so on. Generally speaking, good behavior gets you some minimal luxuries that can get rescinded if your behavior worsens. Assisting the prison staff and generally being a positive force in the prison community usually gives significant but one-off rewards. And lasting significant rewards are provided for major things like helping law enforcement with other cases.

  Conversely, luxuries can be taken away for negative behavior, such as losing entertainment time or options, or being assigned menial tasks. Actual crimes within prison are responded to with stricter security measures and extensions of sentencing.

  Prison terms are fairly flexible. Based on the crime committed, convicts are assigned a *maximum* prison sentence. Minor crimes generally have a maximum sentence of a year or less, while more serious crimes can go up to a decade. Severe crimes that have caused irreparable harm to others can be given a maximum sentence of up to 25 years (if there are mitigating factors) or can be assigned *no* maximum. However, even if a sentence lacks a maximum, that doesn't mean the subject can never be released; in fact, ideally, most subjects will be released from prison before their maximum terms have expired, as a result of rehabilitation efforts.

  "Life in prison" is a possibility, but it's rare, because it goes against the goal of rehabilitation with an eye towards eventual reintegration into society. It is an explicitly *punitive* option invoked in cases of crimes that are deemed to directly undermine Ilessian *institutions*. Primarily, this means High Treason. However, it is worth noting that a life sentence is possible for attacks targeting the families of Ilessian law enforcement, government, military, or emergency services personnel or officials. Due to extensive Reclaimer lobbying, murder committed with a Dreamer power can also be subject to a life sentence in a SIDE detention facility.

  Ilessia does not execute criminals.

  **Rehabilitation:** A primary goal of Ilessian prisons is the rehabilitation of criminals.

  Recognizing that a great many crimes are the result of serious economic problems, the prisons offer educational and vocational training, providing inmates with the skills necessary to productively reenter the workforce upon their release. In the case of Dreamers, SIDE prison facilities offer training in controlling one's powers. Further, prisons are equipped with energy collection technology. Most prison energy collection is slightly more efficient than your average commercial energy collection facility (125% collection), and the cells are particularly efficient at collecting energy at rest. So your average civilian prisoner generates about 4 credits per hour at rest, and 20 credits per hour working efficiently (which they can expect to be able to do for the usual 6+Stamina hours per day). Thus, an average inmate can typically generate a total of 192 credits per day (of course, more athletic inmates can generate more, and Dreamers can generate much more). Most prisons require prisoners to generate at least 150 credits per day.

  25% of energy generated by an inmate is credited to its personal account. Of this, 80% is put into a savings account which the inmate cannot access until release, and the remainder is available to the inmate to send to family or charitable institutions of their choice, exchange with other prisoners, or purchase the occasional thing offered by the prison. The rest is taken by the prison. However, these credits are only used to pay for prison maintenance (actual energy use, supplies, government-mandated salaries for staff, etc). Any credits in excess of the prison's budget are put into a weekly lottery. By default, each prisoner gets five entries into the lottery. More can be given for good behavior/assistance, or their entries can be removed as a punishment. Each week, a certain number of entries are drawn, and that week's lottery is divided among those prisoners' accounts (put entirely into their active accounts, so it's available for use during their incarceration). This ensures prisons are largely self-sufficient, but also don't offer anyone a particular financial stake in, say, how many prisoners they have or the like.

  It also ensures that time in prison is strictly financially negative; even working a basic energy generation job, most people can earn at least twice as much as a prisoner earns with the same amount of effort. However, since 80% of the income is saved over the course of the prisoner's incarceration, the prisoner gets out with a substantial credit reserve, allowing them to immediately get back on their feet.

  If the inmate also has accrued Societal Debt, then up to half of its personal earnings can be taken by the government to cover it. Prisoner earnings are taxed normally. With good behavior, a prisoner who generates more than "its share" of energy may also be able to work out a deal to let some of its overflow go towards family members, Societal Debt, charitable institutions it favors, or the like, rather than being folded back into the lottery.

  Finally, prisons offer therapy and psychiatric services. These are strictly for *behavioral* problems, not actual mental diseases or defects, which are treated in the public health system, not the prison system. But where psychiatric correction can discourage future crime, the prison offers the resources necessary to overcome one's problems and reenter society productively. A big part of actually getting released early involves convincing therapists and evaluators that you understand what you did wrong, you regret it, and you are unlikely to do it again. Medication is also prescribed as needed.

  The services offered by the prisons are mandatory, but not all are mandatory for all inmates. The prison staff determines on an individual basis what services are necessary for which prisoners.

  Once a prisoner is deemed rehabilitated, unless they have a true Life Sentence, they are released, even if their maximum sentence hasn't been served. As long as the prison staff and evaluators are confident that you are ready to reenter society as a productive and law-abiding citizen, they have no further need to incarcerate you. While prisons are meant to be a punishment to serve as a deterrent, they are *not* meant to serve as a *punitive* measure to get "justice" for the victims. This is done through civil suits, or the methods of Societal Debt and Societal Wipe. Naturally, if a former criminal offends again, it will be looking at longer sentences, and it will be harder to convince evaluators of its rehabilitation.

  **Parole:** Parole is a sort of "partial release" from prison. Most of the time, parole is for convicts who reach their maximum sentence without being deemed rehabilitated. In some cases, where a convict is deemed probably rehabilitated but there is some doubt, parole is also assigned.

  A paroled convict is no longer in prison, but they aren't fully free either. The courts place certain limits upon them; where they can go, what jobs they can work, sometimes who they can associate with (if they have known criminal associates), what they can spend money on (barring a small allowance), etc. They are assigned a parole officer who they have to check in regularly with and who can check in on them at will \- and who they can go to for help as needed with their reintegration. Sometimes they are forced to wear tracking devices, power suppressors, or the like. This allows them to reenter society and start making their way, but keeps a government eye on them. As the parole goes on and they appear to be reintegrating nicely, the limitations are gradually relaxed.

  Paroled convicts still have criminal status. Parole can last indefinitely if deemed appropriate, but in most cases it only goes on for a few months to a year.

  **Supervised Release:** Lighter than parole, supervised release is usually for people who seem rehabilitated in a controlled setting, but there's some question about whether they're really entirely ready for release. Unlike a parolee, they have full freedom again, but they are assigned a social worker who they are expected to check in with regularly, who checks in on them at scheduled times, and who they can go to for help with their reintegration into society. In essence, a supervised release is more a "safety net", while a parole is more a "leash".

  Supervised citizens no longer have criminal status (barring any remaining Societal Debts, although that's a different type of criminal status anyway). Supervision never lasts more than a year, and usually only lasts a couple of months, although there are private-sector companies that provide similar services, usually for a fee, some as a charitable service.

  **Redemption:** Redemption is a legal option originally pioneered by Hero Corps, although with the right paperwork it can be invoked by other people who do good work, such as Independent heroes, police, SIDE agents, ACC members, Sentinels, and so on. When a Hero invokes the Redemption clause, it takes a criminal \- typically one with Dreamer powers or some other substantial asset \- into its custody, even if it otherwise still has a prison term to serve. This functions as a sort of parole, and the courts will assess limitations as necessary. Beyond the duties of a parole officer, though, the Hero is obliged to see to the convict's societal rehabilitation.

  But beyond that, the main point of the Redemption clause is to allow the convict to use its powers (or other assets) to do good work under the Hero's guidance. The aim, ideally, is to fully *redeem* the convict by turning them into a powerful positive force in the world.

  The Redemption Clause can even be used to forestall Societal Wipe. Someone with the power to do true good can, with enough work, do enough to atone for even terrible past misdeeds, allowing them to retain their identity \- although some choose to forsake it anyway.

  While Redemption is a great thing, it should not be undertaken lightly. A failed Redemption that leads to further crime or harm can result in legal backlash, and will almost always result in strong social and reputational backlash on the Hero who attempts it. And, of course, it means living with the guilt that you let a villain back on the street, and people were hurt or killed as a result.

  **Criminal Status:** Criminal status is a matter of public record \- *while* the punishment is active. While a sealed record available to law enforcement persists, once a Societal Debt is paid and/or prison sentence served, there is no public record of the criminal activity. Again, the Ilessian justice system is about rehabilitating criminals and returning them to society, which a lingering black mark will not help. Likewise, if a criminal has been rehabilitated, there is no point in a constant reminder of who it *used* to be. There are strict laws against discriminating against people based on past criminal records.

  **Societal Wipe:** Some crimes can never be balanced out by financial reparation. These crimes pretty much always entail a substantial prison sentence, typically an indefinite one, but the way the Ilessian prison system works, with its focus on rehabilitation...this still lacks a certain sense of *justice* for the victims and their loved ones. The prison system is meant to be a punishment, but not punitive; to reform criminals and allow them to reenter society. Civil suits can be used to get justice for lesser crimes, in additional to prison terms. But for some crimes...there needs to be something stronger. This is Societal Wipe.

  Societal Wipe, from a social standpoint, sets the convict back to square one, a blank slate. They are, essentially, cut off from their former identity and assigned a new one \- name, citizen id, and so on. Any assets that they had sole ownership of are seized (following rules for Societal Debt, but immediate). Friends, family, coworkers, and others who knew them are informed of the crime their committed and their loss of identity, and while they are not required to forsake them entirely, it's not uncommon. Finally, unlike most prisoners, they are prohibited from receiving visitors or outside contact in prison.

  Societal Wipe is largely meant to serve as a sort of symbolic execution. Every asset they had, everything they worked on, their reputation and name, are taken from them. Their relationships will often crumble. If they are released from prison, they are, for most intents, an entirely new person. While their new identity has a clean slate (and any credits earned in prison), the old identity will never lose its criminal status. If they ever seek to make use of their old identity, it retains its former criminal status, and they can be subject to a new Societal Wipe and prison sentence if reported. They are not prohibited from contacting those they used to know, although those people may no longer want anything to do with them.

  But they are not dead, nor necessarily imprisoned for life. They can still be rehabilitated and released, and start anew. The person who committed the unforgivable crime, in this case, is *gone*. They have lost everything, which is the most severe punishment the Ilessian legal system will offer. The newly rehabilitated person, so long as it forsakes its old identity, is free to rejoin society and start forging a new, and hopefully better, life.

  **Dreamer Registration:** Ilessia has two major registrars for Dreamers \- the Assembly Registrar, and the Government Registrar. Registration is entirely optional, and anonymous registration is allowed (meaning, civilians can't look it up, and government agencies have to go through protocols). The Assembly is generally preferred for anonymous registration, as they take it very seriously and can require warrants or legally dispute searches, whereas the Government Registrar just needs the proper protocols followed, which can be processed in under an hour for legitimate searches.

  Unregistered Dreamers don't have any problems generally, but they are somewhat more tightly restricted in how they can use their powers on others.

* **Spoiler: The Registration Process**  
* Hide  
  Assembly registration primarily involves two things. Filling out a form, and a basic test of your powers.

  The form at a minimum involves just describing what you can do in your own words, in as much or as little detail as you want, along with basic contact/personal information. The test just involves displaying your powers before an evaluator, to give them an opportunity to measure your overall control and such. The evaluator puts their notes in the database along with your description.

  Once you're registered, your information goes in the Assembly database and is keyed to your ID card. So if SIDE is looking into you for whatever reason, you just swipe your ID card and they see that your powers have been registered and they can see the evaluator's report so they know that you have good control over your power and are fully informed about it (or not, depending on how your registration actually went). The government can also access the file, but they need a full warrant for it and Assembly lawyers generally oppose such efforts as a matter of course to make sure they really have full justification for viewing your file and it's not just fishing or whatever. So it usually takes some time.

  You can register publically, which means anyone who wants to can look up your name and powers freely (and you may use a codename rather than or in addition to your real name if you want); they can't look up your contact information, but they can put in a request with the Assembly to contact you. The Assembly can also contact you for other approved purposes. For example, if there's an emergency where your powers would be useful, or like a job offer looking for someone with your powerset, or if the government searched your file, etc. The Assembly always serves as an intermediary for things like that, and even they have have some protocols for accessing your contact information.

  You can register openly, which means your name (or codename) and powers are publically accessible, but the Assembly isn't authorized to contact you for any purposes except those you explicitly approve beforehand.

  You can register secretly, so your name and powers aren't listed in the public database, but the Assembly can still contact you where appropriate.

  Or you can register privately, not appearing in the public database and not available for Assembly contact, so at this point the only thing the registration does is give you the ID swipe and allow government access to the file with proper warrants.

  Now, that's the minimum, but the Assembly also offers a lot of supplemental services to newly registering Dreamers. There'll be a staffer available to answer questions, discuss your new power, give you examples of how other people with similar powers work, help you figure things out about your power by asking questions or suggesting things to try, fill you in on relevant laws and stuff that might be especially appropriate to you, bring up some job or career opportunities your power would be especially good for, etc. They can also call an IDEA scientist in with Analytical scanners and other power-testing technology to help you get a much more thorough look at what you're capable of. This stuff is good to do \- not only does it give the new Dreamer useful information, but the evaluator will add it to their report. A thoroughly documented evaluator report sets a lot of SIDE's worries at ease when they pull up a registration, whereas a sparse report means they really can't be sure how much control you have and will play things more cautiously with you.

  The alternative (government registration) doesn't include most of the supplemental services or evaluation. You do get an analytical power scan, but they aren't obligated to share the results with you (although they usually do). There is no public database for the government registration, and they won't contact you with job offers and such, although with your authorization they may contact you in the case of an emergency where your power would be helpful. There are some protocols for government employees searching the government registration database, but not any legal rigmarole, so they can do so much more quickly and secretly (the Assembly can contact you if the government searches your file in the Assembly registrar). So obviously, the Assembly registrar is the massively more popular option.

  **Hostile Power Use:** Ilessian law defines a hostile power use as any use of a Dreamer power that:

  * Alters the subject's body or mind against its will.  
  * Causes significant physical pain, mental stress, or emotional trauma.  
  * Causes the target to do something it does not want to do.  
  * Causes physical injury or property damage.  
  * Invades the privacy of a person's home, business, property, or mind.  
  * Violates or invalidates a contract or legal agreement.  
* 

  So crashing a car because you know you'll survive thanks to Regeneration is hostile. Using an illusion to appear more attractive and get someone to go on a date is hostile. Healing someone who doesn't want to be healed is hostile. Invisibly sneaking into an office and rooting through files is hostile. And so on.

  A hostile power use is generally a low-end felony that can carry a sentence as high as 1-3 years. Naturally, many hostile power uses are in themselves other crimes. Importantly, use of Dreamer powers in the commission of another crime can be prosecuted as a special circumstance, increasing the severity of sentencing.

  There are, however, situations where hostile power uses are justified. Self defense and the defense of others is the primary one. Likewise in the defense and security of one's property or business (a super-strong bouncer can use its power to eject people from the establishment, a flame-throwing bodyguard can use its power to respond to threats, etc). Of course, appropriate force is still a factor; responding to a nonlethal threat with lethal force can still land you in a heap of trouble. Using an *unregistered* Dreamer power hostilely is *always* a crime, even in a mitigating circumstance (although the action itself may still be justified).

  It's also worth noting that crimes committed while under the influence of mind-controlling powers are legally considered committed by the controller, not the victim. Yes, people have tried getting a co-conspirator to mind control them into doing what they already want to do. No, it doesn't work.

  Now, with all this said, like any legal system, this isn't a perfect computerized machine of justice. Minor hostile power uses can be glossed over. A Dreamer who saves lives with hostile power use, even unregistered, probably won't be prosecuted or convicted. Good lawyers can get you through a lot of these things (and the Assembly has a very good legal department that often do pro-bono work for Dreamers who get on the wrong side of the law for good reason or who are just in over their heads). Likewise, there can be miscarriages of justice where justified power use gets convicted for various reasons, or non-hostile powers get treated as hostile, or so on.

* **Spoiler**  
* Hide  
  **Complication \- Unregistered:** Your powers aren't registered. Hostile power use is always considered a crime for you, even in mitigating circumstances (although the action itself may be justified, the power use is not). This can land you in trouble with the law and make active heroics difficult.

  **Benefit \- Licensed Power:** You have a license to do something with a power that would normally only be allowed in special circumstance, if at all. This license isn't strictly unlimited, it has its terms, but they're a lot broader than normal and even if you go outside, prosecuting you for it is going to be a pain. You might have a license to kill with your powers in service of a government agency like IN-SIDE, to freely read the minds of others as part of an official criminal investigation, and so on.  
  A role playing game is three things. It is an interactive story, a game of chance, and a process in critical thinking.

  If brevity is the soul of wit, I'm witty like a vampire\!

  **The Big Five \- Ilessian Regions and Major Cities**

  **Arbera \- The Capital**

  *Size:* 12,000 square miles.  
  *Population:* 50,000,000.  
  *Regional Population:* 200,000,000.

  The capital city of Ilessia is also the second-largest city in the country, covering about 12,000 square miles pretty much smack-dab in the center of the country. "Bustling" is both the primary word that could be used to describe Arbera and also entirely insufficient to convey the city's nature. Arbera is the country's political, legal, and commercial center. It is *also* the center of Ilessia's entertainment industry. People in Aranth say Arbera the same way people on Earth say Hollywood. Naturally, all of this means that the city has a huge media presence covering all the stories and scandals. This is a city with a lot of highly-visible jobs that attract big-ego personalities. Politicians, lawyers, actors, producers, CEOs, journalists, lobbyists, diplomats...people looking to make a name for themselves know the capital is where to do it. If you can endure the hectic pace and navigate the often-treacherous social waters.

  "Nothing is nothing in Arbera" is something of an unofficial slogan for the city. The media is constantly on watch for the next big thing, be that a new up-and-comer with big ideas or a scandal that can bring down the entrenched elite. It's a city where it often seems that everybody has an opinion and nobody is shy about sharing it. People take sides in Arbera \- nowhere is the conflict between the Assembly and the Reclaimers more cutthroat, for example. That being said, despite Arbera's reputation as a city of constant bustle and ambition, not everyone can be a big name. Millions of the city's residents live among the elite and those trying to become the elite, doing normal jobs and living normal lives. The normal people of Arbera tend to a demeanor of jaded bemusement. They've seen it all, and the noise and chaos just slides off their shoulders as they give a little smirk and shake of their heads. These are savvy people who take little at face value, and know well how to consider the facts and come to their own conclusions.

  Arbera's skyline is a sight to see. The capital is home to several thousand towering skyscrapers that house everything from movie studios to apartment complexes to business headquarters. Just in general, buildings in Arbera tend to be bigger than in most of the country. Arbera doesn't have as much as some cities in the way of architectural creativity, but its buildings are sleek, practical, and ultra-modern. Arbera has the largest population of flying vehicles in the country, with just over seventy percent of the city's vehicles flight-capable.

  One thing that doesn't last long in Arbera is organized or career crime \- at least, not on the more personal levels. Arbera doesn't have that much of a military presence, but the National Watch is headquartered there, and Arbera has a large enough Regional Guard force and SIDE presence to qualify as armies in their own rights. More than that, Hero Corps, the ACC, and the Sentinel Project all have their largest headquarters in Arbera. Finally, Arberan streets are protected by the largest number of registered independent crime-fighters in the country. Gangs, organized crime syndicates, Defiant cells, and the like really just don't stand a chance.

  Now, this isn't to say the city is free of crime and peril. It just wears a different face. *White collar* crime is a persistent problem in Arbera, as is all manner of corruption. There are plenty of big-name, big-ego people who exploit their wealth and power to the harm of others. Corporate espionage, political assassinations, police brutality, and elite thieving rings all exist within the capital, and a villain with good enough publicity can amass a terrifying amount of power without ever getting so much as investigated. Worse still, all of the powerful organizations that keep the city relatively free of more low-brow crime will often take the side of those criminals who ooze beneath their radars. Where a Hero seeking to keep the streets safe may find little threat or challenge in Arbera, a heroic vigilante or cowboy cop trying to stop corruption at the root will find no small amount of danger within the pristine capital.

  **The Assembly in Arbera:** Arbera is the Assembly's *playground*. Politics, law, media, entertainment, commerce...all the best and biggest pies that the Assembly has their super-powered fingers in are central to the Capital. The Assembly presence in Arbera is surprisingly, almost terrifyingly, pervasive. It is often said that the Assembly wields more power in Arbera than any single political party. This...may or may not be strictly true, but it's probably not far off the mark.

  Arbera Hero Corps has something like a hundred members active at any one time, and the region itself has at least twice that many spread throughout its environs. Arberan Heroes tend to be flashy and powerful, with a strong tendency towards over-the-top costumes and codenames, always happy to make a big speech as they lead the evil-doer away with a smile for every camera and a high-five for every kid they pass. Fact is, though, Arbera isn't a city that really *needs* more defenders, and so it tends to attract the sort of Hero that are more in it for the prestige and publicity than the job. Heroes from other regions \- and, for that matter, from smaller towns and cities within the Arbera region that actually have serious crime and threats to deal with and don't have massive hordes of defenders available at all hours of the day \- have a tendency to look down on them some.

  The Assembly Cleanup Crew, though, is as kind-hearted and earnest an organization here as they are anywhere. They're of the mind that just because their city doesn't often face the damage of uncontrolled superpowered battles, explosive Defiant attacks, gang wars, and whatever else, doesn't mean they just sit on their laurels and collect a paycheck or trot out every weekend for a photo shoot. They actively seek out things they can make better, and then do it, frequently traveling to other cities when there is a need.

  The Regional Commander of the Arbera Hero Corps is Elena Gallego, Codename: Nope (she's never actually made clear if this is her intentionally chosen codename, or if she's opposed to codenames and "nope" is just her response to those who ask, since given her powerset both kinda fit). Her Dreamer power is Physical Law Immunity. PL 14+2.

  **SIDE in Arbera:** SIDE wears something of a different face in Arbera, really emphasizing the investigative chops of FIRE-SIDE and IN-SIDE. Arbera is a city with lots of Dreamers running around among CEOs, politicians, judges, and other extremely socially powerful people. Arbera SIDE focuses less on bringing in dangerous Dreamers through sheer martial might and tactical skill, and more on weeding out Dreamers using their powers to spy on, manipulate, or coerce others. This does not, however, mean they are incapable of the former, especially considering the full *eight Battle Squadrons* that Arbera SIDE can bring to bear if required, with another two potentially available in reserve forces.

  SIDE is largely more cognizant than many law enforcement organizations about the presence of crime and corruption in the upper echelons of the Arberan elite. Often, their hands are kinda tied due to jurisdictional regulations, buuuut, well, let's just say that IN-SIDE has some files that they shouldn't have, and those files sometimes get left \- entirely accidentally, of course \- on certain FIRE-SIDE agents' desks, and since there are, of course, very few records of these files, it can be no surprise when occasionally a few of them wind up falling into the hands of a trusted Hero, independent crime fighter, vigilante, local cop, grizzled PI, or the like.

  **IDEA in Arbera:** Crazy scientific experiments aren't exactly the favorites of Arbera. IDEA in the capital tends to put its best foot forward. The Departments of Analysis and Education, Dreamer Studies, and Dreamtech Analysis \- that is, the more "studious" than "creative" branches \- are the most active in Arbera. Arberan IDEA has...much less of a reputation for the sort of crazy shenanigans the organization often gets up to elsewhere.

  Except, well, Dreamcatchers. There is a *persistent* and terrifying Dreamcatcher presence in Arbera, and so far despite all the efforts of Hero Corps, SIDE, the Watch, the Guard, independent crime fighters, and even vigilantes, Dreamers still routinely vanish from their lives without any warning, and those that do return are...changed.

  **The Reclaimers in Arbera:** The Reclaimers are big in Arbera. Not as big as the Assembly, but big enough to at least kep the Assembly from acting with *complete* impunity. The media fights between Arberan Reclaimer and Assembly representatives are a constant source of entertainment. That said, much like IDEA, the Reclaimers put their best foot forward in the capital. The Sentinel Project is an extremely well-respected institution in Arbera, the Defiant are pretty much non-existent, and the more political factions of the Reclaimers are reasonable and well-spoken. In terms of media presence, public approval, and political capital, the Assembly definitely has an edge, but if nothing else the Reclaimers keep them honest. That being said, the occasional spectacular breakdown on live television has been known to happen.

  **Big Dreams in Arbera:** As the country's center of commerce, it should be little surprise that Big Dreams, Inc. is headquartered in Arbera, as are many of their subsidies and child companies, including DreamCorp. In Arbera, the focus of Big Dreams is less on finding Dreamers a place in other businesses, and more on building up Dreamer businesses. Investments and stock trading are the biggest part of Big Dreams' Arberan operations, and the company is responsible for scores of Dreamer-run businesses profitizing the powers of their CEOs and other upper-level management. Big Dreams generally tries to avoid the more political side of the city, and keep the media at a professional arm's length. It's often said that they're not here to influence policy or sway opinion \- they're here to make money.

  **Adaros \- The Big City**

  *Size:* 18,000 square miles.  
  *Population:* 90,000,000.  
  *Regional Population:* 280,000,000.

  Adaros is the single largest city in Ilessia. It's a sprawling urban center, covering about 18,000 square miles \- a block roughly 300 miles long and sixty wide situated smack-dab in the center of the south-most portion of Ilessia, going right up to the twenty-mile-wide no-man's land that is the negotiated border between Ilessia and Limbra.

  The reason for its size is largely military, and dates back some five hundred years to when Ilessia and Libra were bitter enemies. Adaros occupies a sizable chunk of the area around the Ilessia-Limbra border. As more bases, fortresses, and so on were built to strengthen defense against Limbran incursions (or provide a gathering point for Ilessian attacks into Limbra), more infrastructure sprang up to support the bases. For a long time, the Adaros leadership was largely hand in hand with the military, so rather than founding new towns and cities to support their bases, they continued expanding the one \- which of course resulted in population growth and a relative increase in political power. The city's growth was only really checked once treaties and alliances were formed between the two nations.

  Today, Adaros remains *the* major military center of Ilessia, at least in terms of ground forces, though being entirely land-locked, its naval forces are nonexistent. It's famed for its architecture \- the portion of the city closest to the border is in particular scattered with old-school, solid stone fortresses designed to both withstand attacks and give an impression of majesty and power to whoever attacked them. Many wealthy citizens or businesses, churches, and so on over the years have designed their buildings with that same idea in mind \- and gone wild on beautiful design work to differentiate their structures from those of the military. While more modern buildings have replaced many older structures, throughout the city you can still find hundreds of old-style fortresses, barracks, churches, and even full-fledged castles, many of which are still in use, after some modernization. It's important to note that even with more modern buildings replacing many of the old-style ones, the city has in no way foregone its architectural roots. Some of the finest architects and engineers in the world are responsible for designing Adaros and its buildings, and many businesses and wealthy citizens compete to show off.

  Despite its sheer size and rather piecemeal development, the combination of brilliant engineering and military organization leaves Adaros an extremely well-organized city. The city is laid out as a huge grid, with several streets (and two huge highways) that stretch its entire length, divided by smaller streets that go along its with, creating individual square-mile "megablocks". Each megablock is usually under the purview of a specific architect or design firm, so the exact nature of street layouts and building designs can vary widely between them, and they can range from pure efficient practicality to wildly creative artistic layouts.

  The emphasis on organization extends to more than city layout. The *bureaucracy* of Adaros is (in)famous throughout Ilessia. While the military and the city government are no longer essentially one and the same, the military still has ties to the government, and many people who start their careers in the Adaros military end them in the city government. They are *extremely* efficient, and *extremely* intolerant of any break in procedure or other hold-up. In short, lines go by quickly, and they have absolutely no qualm about sending you straight to the back if you reach their desks without everything you need in exactly the right state to process.

  Nowhere is Ilessia's rivalry with Limbra more clear than in Adaros. While the military feuds may be things of the past, business rivalries have sprang up to replace them. Many of the largest companies in the country are based in Adaros. Some companies own an enitre megablock, placing their main operation, homes for their employees, and various small businesses all together like little square-mile mini-towns in the middle of the huge city. Some of the most famous of these are huge resort blocks, owned by major hotels or casinos. Adaros isn't as big on tourism as, say, Verdania, but the resort blocks specialize in luxury getaways within the city, ideal for busy people looking for a brief vacation or soldiers looking to blow off steam. It was a huge controversy when the Children of Paradise were allowed to purchase a megablock and declare the entire thing \- a full square mile of Ilessian territory \- as Paradisian soil.

  While crime is not rampant in Adaros, it is extremely tenacious. Just as there are entire megablocks owned by big businesses, so to are there some that have been largely taken over by gangs or big criminal organizations. Some of the biggest businesses and fanciest casinos are fronts for even more elaborate, even more profitable crime syndicates that operate with varying degrees of secrecy. One of the biggest problems with crime in Adaros is that the criminals are able to get their hands on military-grade weaponry, among other things \- the black market in Adaros is absolutely thriving. It's a big problem and the military vastly underreports how often it happens, but the fact of the matter is that ousting the worst of the worst would require the equivalent of a small-scale war.

  **The Assembly in Adaros:** The center of the Assembly in Adaros is called Dream Street, a single long street full of Assembly offices, businesses, studios, and so on. Calling it a "single street" only gives you half of the story though. The Assembly owns a megablock, which Dream Street runs through east to west, multiple times in parallel lines. Extensive work with space-folding Dreamer powers causes each line of the street to feed into the next, with many side-streets leading to different locations. Navigating Dream Street can be...difficult for the uninitiated, but people who know its twists and turns can get pretty much anywhere within it in a minute or less, give or take for stoplights. And for those who don't, well, "when in doubt, keep going straight".

  Adaros has about forty Heroes in operation at any one time, but their turnover rate is...high. A lot of Heroes eventually get pulled into a conflict with one of the larger criminal organizations, and sadly, such conflicts have a tendency to only go well for so long. The Heroes of Adaros have a reputation for bring grimmer, more serious, and less flashy than those of other regions. They have a *big* area to cover, have lost a lot of comrades and only been able to get justice for a few of them. It can be hard.

  While Adaros doesn't have the entertainment chops of Arbera, it *does* have a thriving theater and concert scene, and the Assembly has a robust presence there. Dreamer powers can add a level of special effects to live performances that can match even the best CGI firms, and as impressive as such things may be on the big scene, watching them *live* is another experience entirely. The Assembly's legal resources are also put to extensive use in Adaros, often dealing with the legal side of the fierce competition for Dreamers among the city's businesses...or sometimes defending Dreamers who have used their powers for less savory ends.

  The Regional Commander of the Adaros Hero Corps is Corbin Pharos, Codename: Arcanis. His Dreamer power is Magic. PL 14+2.

  **SIDE in Adaros:** Most Ilessian towns have a single SIDE agent or, maybe, a SIDE unit working with the police to deal with or at least consult on Dreamer crimes. Larger cities have full SIDE headquarters that can field entire Combat Units, sometimes more than one. Major cities have at least a Battle Squadron available.

  Adaros SIDE is capable of fielding four full Battle Squadrons, with at least one more available as a reserve force, to say nothing for having the single largest contingent of OUT-SIDE soldiers in the entire country.

  And they are *astonishingly* overworked.

  Many criminal organizations have at least one significant Dreamer on staff, and those Dreamers have a huge impact on their operations. SIDE works night and day trying to separate them from their networks and take them down. It's a difficult and thankless job, and a lot of SIDE agents are extremely frustrated that even if they can remove the Dreamers from the equation, they can't bring down the criminal operations as a whole. OUT-SIDE, being legally only allowed to operate on Ilessian soil for reactive defensive measures, catches a lot of flak for having the weaponry and training to actually bring down some of these organizations, but not actually doing it. Resultantly, tensions between SIDE and Hero Corps tend to be high.

  **IDEA in Adaros:** IDEA has various operations throughout Adaros, but the DDA and DDD are by far the most prominent. They work *extensively* with both the military and various business interests. Competition for the work and consultation of top IDEA scientists is fiercer than competition for powerful Dreamers, and the money flows freely. IDEA scientists mostly operate in labs provided by the businesses or groups they work for (the biggest military base in the city also hosts a state of the art IDEA facility), but there has been talk of several top scientists, with the assistance of corporate sponsors, purchasing a megablock to create a "Dreamtech playground" as it's been described. There have been...more than a few terrified reactions to the plan.

  **The Reclaimers in Adaros:** The Reclaimers are bigger in Adaros than any other city in the country, for a few reasons. First, there's the simple fact that the Sentinel Project is directly responsible for "taking back" no less than three entire megablocks from the huge gangs (each led by Dreamers) that had previously controlled them. Second, the fierce competition among businesses has led to huge swaths of layoffs caused by the acquisition of Dreamer employees whose powers can replace hundreds or even thousands of workers, resulting in a lot of simmering resentment. The controversy surrounding Paradisia's megablock definitely played to the Reclaimers' advantage. Perhaps most importantly though, Defiant make up a statistically much smaller percentage of crazy people running around with high-powered weaponry in Adaros than they do in many other cities, and as citizens of the largest city in the nation, the people of Adaros are much more cognizant of the fact that in any large enough group of people, you're going to get some bad apples.

  That said, the scale of the Adaros black market means that members of the Defiant are able to get weapons more easily than anywhere else in the country \- and more powerful ones too. The Defiant don't tend to cluster into one big operation the way many gangs and criminal networks do \- rather, they're spread throughout the city's underworld, working with this gang or that crime family, turning the resources of these powerful illegal organizations against Dreamers wherever they can get the chance. The Defiant are a pervasive threat in Adaros, and just how deeply their reach extends into the various great crime syndicates in the city is terrifyingly uncertain.

  **Big Dreams in Adaros:** Both the Dream Job's Center and Dream Team Securities are headquartered in Adaros rather than Arbera, and do some of their biggest work there. Where in Arbera they emphasize to creation and development of Dreamer-run businesses under the Big Dreams umbrella, in Adaros the company's focus is more on getting Dreamers highly-paid positions in the city's various big businesses \- often allowing companies to save millions on labor costs that a single skilled Dreamer can replace. The company saves money, the Dreamer earns a wage appropriate to the value of its powers, and Big Dreams makes a tidy commission. Everyone wins\! Well, except for the dozens, scores, or hundreds of workers laid off as a result.

  Dream Team Securities, meanwhile, conducts an extensive operation providing support and even gear for the military, and security for businesses and private citizens. In a city where criminals can regularly get access to military-grade weaponry, security forces capable of dealing with such threats are in high demand.

  **Verdania \- The Crossroads**

  *Size:* 8,000 square miles.  
  *Population:* 40,000,000.  
  *Regional Population:* 190,000,000.

  Verdania is Ilessia's center of tourism and trade. The third largest city in the country is situated on the western coast. Boasting the largest air and seaports in Ilessia, as a military center Verdania is second only to Adaros. The bulk of Ilessia's naval forces and a substantial portion of their Air Force are based in Verdania. That being said, Verdania is not built around being a military center the way Adaros is. Regularly called the Crossroads of Ilessia, Verdania is a place where people are coming and going all the time. Though a center for tourism, Verdania itself doesn't have many major monuments or other "must see" locations. What it does have is a lot of attractions, hotels, shopping centers, entertainment options, fine restaurants, and other places to allow vacationing tourists, in-port sailors, visiting businesspeople, and other travelers a nearly endless supply of ways to ensure their stay is enjoyable, whether they are visiting for weeks or just passing through for a couple of days.

  The region around Verdania has some of the nicest and most diverse settings in Ilessia. From the towering Erdas mountains in the center of the region to its two great lakes, from the tropical jungles of its southern reaches to the snow-dusted pine forests to the north. Rolling hills and jagged cliffs, deep woods and beautiful beaches, the Verdanian Region is a picturesque setting filled with scattered tourist towns, cities, and resorts, as well as a scattered assortment of protected wilderness areas, national parks, and old keeps, castles, and other landmarks. Many visitors to Verdania itself only stay a day or two before moving on to their intended destination \- but it's rarely advised that one skip out on seeing the city entirely.

  The people of Verdania tend to be friendly and welcoming (outwardly at least; there's plenty of jokes and complaints at the expense of tourists behind closed doors). Almost everyone has advice and suggestions on where to go and what to see. Ask ten Verdanians where the best place to eat is, and you can expect to get ten different answers. The most common places for visitors to check out are Port Verdant, a sprawling coastal marketplace, and the Crossroads, which is the mile-or-so-radius area around the airport filled with hundreds of shops, restaurants, hotels, casinos, parks, malls, theaters, and other attractions. But these aren't the only parts of the city that cater to tourists or just locals looking to have a good time.

  Verdania has a large immigrant population \- Indelans in particular, as Verdania has welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees since the start of Haptarus' conquest. But there are communities of just about every population on the planet in the city. Verdania tends to be considered the most casual of the Big Five. There's definitely a zestful energy and kind of intuitive organizational structure to the city, but it lacks the sheer hectic pace and bustle of Arbera, the regimented order of Adaros, the isolated quietude of Lastelle, or the strong sense of tradition of Estruan. People do their thing, live their lives, and don't stress over much.

  Much ado is made about Verdania as a tourist spot, but it's important to remember that it thrives equally on trade. Verdania has plenty of big business interests, although not as many corporate headquarters as say Arbera or Adaros. That said, CEOs, salespeople, negotiators, and others who thrive on meeting and greeting are more likely to operate out of a Verdanian location even if their main headquarters is elsewhere. Probably the best way to put it is, a company might have a location in other cities for people to *work*, and one in Verdania from which to *conduct business*.

  Now, this is not to say that Verdania is completely idyllic and peaceful. The city has its share of crime. The Crossroads, in particular, is largely in the grip of a criminal organization known as the Committee. They own a sizeable portion of the businesses there, using them as front operations for such things and drugs and weapons smuggling, money laundering, human trafficking, and so on \- to say nothing for the protection rackets, corporate espionage, assassination, thefts, sabotage, and other more corporate crimes they get up to. That said, crime against *tourists* in the Crossroads is very rare, as they're where the money comes from in the first place.

  Tourists do have to take more care in some of the less-traveled parts of the city, though. Gangs protecting their territory, ambitious kidnappers and muggers looking for people out of their element or who won't be missed, and the occasional Dreamcatcher, serial killer, or similar danger can come upon those who turn down the wrong poorly-lit street on the wrong night. And then there's the Underground. Old subways, sewers, catacombs, mines, and other subterranean areas have over time become a sort of city beneath the city that serves as every bit a crossroads as the city above for those who don't conduct their business in the light of day. Someone who knows the labyrinthian passages well enough can get just about anywhere in the city without once setting foot above ground, and all manner of ilicit opportunities and black market products can be found in the tunnels beneath Verdania's streets.

  **The Assembly in Verdania:** The main Assembly location in Verdania is the Tower of Dreams, a forty-story skyscraper holding hundreds of offices and conference rooms. While Verdania isn't the big name in entertainment that Arbera is, it's still a thriving industry, and in particular Verdania and its surrounding locales are regularly used as locations for shooting all manner of shows and movies. A lot of television shows are also produced in and around Verdania. Verdania itself, being the crossroads of Ilessia, is also a common place for movies to be set in. As a result, a lot of what people, especially foreigners, think about Ilessia and its various institutions comes from depictions of Verdania.

  Verdania has roughly the same give-or-take-forty full-time Heroes that Adaros can field, but being a smaller city without as fierce a criminal element they're quite a bit less overworked. That said, with all the comings and goings, and the persistent crime they do have, the Verdanian Heroes have plenty of opportunity to do good work. They tend to be confident, in themselves and each other, well assured by a history of success even against stiff odds. They find a good balance between the actual hero work and the PR side of it, many of them seeing the latter as an important part of the job not so much for the glory or reputation, but because it allows them to serve as inspirations for others. There is a lot of good-natured competition among the Heroes of Verdania; while they won't let it get in the way of keeping people safe, it's generally considered bad form to interfere in a conflict another Hero has already gone to stop, unless requested or lives are at immediate risk. It's not uncommon for threats posted to the Hero App to be replied to first by the responding Hero, and then a bunch of other Heroes with irreverent commentary such as bets on how fast the problem will be solved, or suggestions on how to make it look good, or if there's not much risk, challenges for making it a more difficult (and thereby impressive) fight.

  In addition to its standing forces, Heroes Abroad is based out of Verdania Hero Corps. There are usually only a few of them actually in the city at any given time, though.

  The Regional Commander of the Verdania Hero Corps is Barrett Anderson, Codename: Interceptor. His Dreamer power is Teleportation and Physical Enhancement. PL 13+2.

  **SIDE in Verdania:** SIDE has a robust presence in Verdania, up to and including three Battle Squadrons, with a fourth available in reserve forces. However, given the amount of travel and tourism centered around Verdania, IN-SIDE has an especially strong presence there, coordinating not just the internal moderation of the city's SIDE forces, but also extensive spying operations abroad. Verdania SIDE works also closely with Hero Corps in the classic, "Hero Corps neutralizes the threat, SIDE processes the criminals" style.

  **IDEA in Verdania:** IDEA has its share of facilities in Verdania, although the biggest presence happens to be the Department of Biomechanics. That's...not always a good thing; while Verdania doesn't have anywhere near the Dreamcatcher presence of, say, Arbera, there have been several reports of Dreamers being kidnapped in Verdania and forcibly grafted with cybernetic "enhancements" for their powers in torturous experiments. Most of these poor souls wind up installed with neural compliance technology and sold through underworld connections to buyers all over the world who want powerful, loyal Dreamer servants or soldiers with an extra edge. On the more positive side, though, Verdania is one of the top places to go to for treatments for all manner of genetic maladies. The Department of Dreamer Studies also has a strong presence in Verdania, and in fact, one particular facility staffed by DBM and DDS scientists is on the cutting edge of research into artificially inducing or removing Dreamer powers. Granted, this has led to certain, um, side effects, but you know, Hero Corps enjoys the occasional giant monster fight...\!

  **The Reclaimers in Verdania:** The Reclaimers tend to hit the nadir of their always-shaky popularity in Verdania. Part of this is because the Defiant tend to be a fairly cyclical presence here, every few years gearing up for some big attack on some significant Dreamer institution, causing a lot of damage before getting their butts handed to them by Hero Corps, and then restarting the process of building back up their power. Verdania being such a melting pot doesn't really help either; it's an egalitarian city even considering the norm for Aranth, so the Reclaimers' fear and hatred of Dreamers for their differences is particularly poorly received. A lot of Reclaimers operate under the radar, often keeping their affiliation secret from friends and family. That all said, the Sentinel Project is the only group making any real progress at trying to push the Committee out of the Crossroads...although even then, rumors abound that they also provide training and weaponry to more radical Defiant elements.

  **Big Dreams in Verdania:** While not as big a business center as Arbera and Adaros, Verdania's thriving trade and tourism enterprises offer a lot of room for Big Dreams to work. The Network is especially prevalent here, connecting Dreamers with businesses all over the country and the world, negotiating deals and investing in thousands of small Dreamer-run businesses. Estimates are that more than half of DreamCorp's products pass through Verdania at some point...and that percentage is even higher for the more illicit products they offer.

  **Estruan \- The Heartlands**

  *Size:* 15,000 square miles.  
  *Population:* 30,000,000.  
  *Regional Population:* 180,000,000.

  Situated in the center of the eastern region of Ilessia, Estruan in the hub of the Ilessian heartlands. The Estruan region runs from the mountains and mines of the north through the fertile fields and farms of the central plains, on down to the humid marshes and rain forests of the south. Where Arbera is known for politics and entertainment, Adaros for business and military, and Verdania for tourism and trade, the Estruan region is where Ilessia's *production* is most heavily concentrated. The city of Estruan is the central hub of the region, where the various resources of the region pass through on their way out to the rest of the country. All of the biggest highways and railroads in Ilessia pass through Estruan at some point.

  Estruan is a sprawling city \- not as big as Adaros, but it covers more total land than Arbera, despite having barely more than half the population. It's a major production center, the inner city filled with warehouses for storing raw materials and resources and factories that turn them into finished products. It's also dotted with several geothermal energy plants. The Estruan region in general covers a very geomantically active area. On the downside, this means regular earthquakes and even occasional volcanic eruptions trouble the region, but on the plus side it means access to high-energy geothermal nodes.

  The people of Estruan tend to be straight-forward, no-nonsense, and hard-working in their daily lives. But once they've clocked out it can be another matter entirely. Large gatherings with good food, ample drink, and loud music are something of an Estruan tradition. They may not have the Verdanian reputation for *friendliness*, but let nobody question the hospitality or politeness of the people of the Estruan region. As more than a few visitors have put it, "They make you feel welcome, just not necessarily at home." The most popular form of entertainment in Estruan is various sporting events, and Estruans have a reputation for fanatical devotion to their local teams.

  While most of the city is clean and bustling, as one moves further and further in, quality of buildings, roads, and public works does tend to deteriorate. Crime is a constant problem in the central districts of Estruan, and more resources are dedicated to keeping it contained than actually cleaning it up. There are several large criminal organizations in the center of the city, but all of them pay at least lip service to the crime lord known only as "the Ace". The Ace is officially the single most wanted individual in Estruan \- in practice, though, he or she keeps the other criminals in a state of simmering competition without becoming all-out war. It's an unpleasant truth that removing the Ace from the Estruan underworld might easily cause more harm than good.

  A fairly large portion of Estruan's population is somewhat transient. Aside from the constantly coming and going caravaners, you often have people bringing goods to market in late autumn, staying over the winter, and then heading back to their farms and mines in early spring. There's also a fairly steady stream of young people fed up with life in the many small towns and communities spread throughout the Heartlands making their way to the big city, no few of which find themselves heading back home after only a few years.

  Estruan has the smallest percentage of its population of all the big five cities (and this statistic extends regionally as well) working in energy farms, and energy farm work tends to be looked down on there. A bit over half of the farms, mines, lumber yards, quarries, and so on are privately owned and run, often by an individual with a few employees or a family. This isn't to say they are *small* operations; thanks to the automation and robotics technology of Aranth, a small group of people can run a highly productive business, and thanks to Aranth's renewable production methods and things like arboriums and indoor production facilities, you can get a lot of production out of a relatively small amount of space; many Estruan farms and other operations cover just a couple dozen acres. So these are high-tech setups, although they do nonetheless manage to retain a certain rural charm.

  Beyond the mundane production jobs, you have lots of geomantic energy production in the region, and a typical geomantic plant requires many skilled workers to make sure everything runs smoothly (it's, you know, *kinda* important when you're extracting pure energy from the unstable bowels of the earth, and all). Many small towns in the region basically spring up to support a local geomantic plant. Many highly skilled craftspeople make their homes in Estruan, and their hand-crafted works fetch high prices throughout the city, region, and country. And while it may have a rustic air, a lot of Estruans are highly technologically savvy, often creating or upgrading their own machines, drones, and robots to improve their efficiency. Estruan craftsmanship also applies to these tools; a well-maintained piece of Estruan technology can last for generations.

  And then there's the caravaners, transporters that lead an entire small fleet of driverless trucks. The caravaners have a certain folk mythology about them in Estruan; think a sort of trucker/biker combo. They usually travel in pairs, and sometimes several will all ride out together in single massive caravans. They have impressive vehicular, mechanical, and technological skill and a reputation for daring; even when problems come up, it's something of an unspoken Rule of the Road that you don't stop the caravan unless you *have* to. In severe cases, they'll drive off the road with the stricken truck to perform repairs, but there are plenty of stories of them leaping truck to truck to fix a problem at highway speeds, or coming up to enact repairs from the seat of their motorcycles. And of course, they are prepared to answer any attempt to hijack or rob their caravans with their trusty autoshotguns.

  **The Assembly in Estruan:** The Assembly tends to operate more on the social scale in Estruan. Estruan in general is somewhat less enamored with Dreamer powers than other regions in the country. In a lot of ways, they see them as kinda unnecessary shortcuts. The people of Estruan don't mind hard work and put more faith in their skills and their machines than supernatural powers. Dreamers, as a result, sometimes feel they have a hard time fitting in in Estruan, and the Assembly does a lot to help them to do so. Beyond that...well, let's just say that the Estruan love of sports extends fully to Dreamer-based sporting events. Dreamer athletes can expect every bit as much celebrity in Estruan as Dreamer actors and artists can find in other regions.

  The ACC also does a lot of work in Estruan and its outlying region thanks to the geomantic instability of the region. When earthquakes hit or volcanoes erupt, you can be the Assembly Cleanup Crew will be among the first ones there, repairing the damage and helping life get back to normal. The ACC is *deeply* respected in Estruan, even by their normal standards. Even Estruan Reclaimers tend to have good things to say about them.

  The city of Estruan typically has some thirty Heroes on call regularly. They're a rowdy, boisterous bunch, regarded with affectionate bemusement by most of the people they serve. "Happy to help" is something of an unofficial slogan for Estruan Heroes, and indeed their days tend to be filled less with super-powered crime-fighting and more with flying around providing random help to whatever folks catch their eye. The majority of Heroes see the mostly-mundane crime that has spread throughout the inner city as more-or-less beneath them, although the inner city has its share of registered independents or outright vigilantes working to clean up the streets (with the big distinction between them often being that the vigilantes go hard trying to take down the Ace, while the independents are more cautious about upsetting that particular status-quo). There's quite a bit of tension between these independent crime fighters and the city's official Heroes.

  The Regional Commander of the Estruan Hero Corps is Dixie Beckert, Codename: Lucid. Her Dreamer power is Psionics. PL 13+2.

  **SIDE in Estruan:** SIDE operates a bit abnormally in Estruan. Where in most major cities SIDE operates independently, in Estruan they tend to operate in direct conjunction with local law enforcement. Most police departments and sheriff offices in Estruan include anywhere from a single SIDE agent to a small group of them. The SIDE agents take the lead in dealing with Dreamers, but are officially sworn in as both police and SIDE, and so are able to lend their skill and support to mundane investigations as well. This somewhat limits the amount of raw power that Estruan SIDE can easily bring to bear (although it's estimated that if they needed to, the SIDE forces in the city could field the equivalent of three Battle Squadrons), it makes their local law enforcement that much more savvy and capable when dealing with both mundane and Dreamer crimes. Likewise, DES-SIDE works on security in prisons that take both mundane and Dreamer criminals, making even normal prisons that much more secure and even allowing some better gradiation for Dreamer prisoners whose powers don't demand some of the more extreme security measures that a full-fledged SIDE prison would normally make standard.

  **IDEA in Estruan:** Estruan is the production center of Ilessia, and that title extends to energy as well as raw materials. So it should be no surprise that IDEA's Department of Energy Management is big in Estruan, constantly innovating new ways to collect, store, and transport energy. Many power plants \- be they nuclear, geothermal, solar, or wind \- have IDEA DEM scientists on staff working to improve their efficiency. Although, given the enthusiasm of IDEA and the occasional geomantic instability of the region, this...can occasionally lead to issues.

  **The Reclaimers in Estruan:** The Reclaimers are probably at the top of their game in Estruan, although this is less prominent in the city itself. Nonetheless, the Estruan tendency to favor old-fashioned hard work over Dreamer powered solutions does make fertile soil for the Reclaimers. Likewise, a lot of people do have a quiet fear of the sort of Dreamer-driven layoffs that you hear about in places like Adaros. It's not the Estruan way, but not *all* production operations are private, and if enough owners of big farms, mines, and plants decided to embrace the sheer efficiency of replacing workers with Dreamers, it could cause a major upset to the Estruan way of life, and the Reclaimer message resonates with that fear. Likewise, Dreamers are a *lot* less common in the small towns that cover so much of the region \- there are plenty of people in the Estruan region and even in the city itself that have never personally met a Dreamer (or at least, that they knew was a Dreamer). Even today, Dreamers are more of an unknown to a lot of people in Estruan, and that prompts more fear.

  That said, the Reclaimers also don't tend to be as much of an organized entity in Estruan. They're more a political movement or even a general mindset than a cohesive group in a lot of ways. Many people have Reclaimer leanings or belief, but not as many would outright identify themselves as Reclaimers.

  The Sentinel Project also gets a lot of kudos for doing what they can to clean up the inner city. It's pretty much taken as a given that the Ace is a Dreamer of some kind, and the Sentinels are putting more effort than any group in the city towards uncovering his/her/their identity and bringing them to justice.

  **Big Dreams in Estruan:** Big Dreams struggles a bit in Estruan, it's true. This isn't a place that favors big business interests and Dreamer powered work forces. But Estruan is hardly a write-off for Big Dreams. As far as they're concerned, if the other companies in the region don't want to be competitive, that's *their* problem. Big Dreams has fingers in all areas of production, and DreamCorp is relentless about squeezing the competition from buying exclusively from Big Dreams producers. They haven't been able to dominate the market as yet, but they are fairly brazen about their efforts to do so. Many of Estruan's people see them as leeches, trying to suck the lifeblood from the Ilessian Heartlands to feed their own bottom line.

  **Lastelle \- The Quiet Place**

  *Size:* 2,000 square miles.  
  *Population:* 40,000,000.  
  *Regional Population:* 150,000,000.

  Occupying the northern reaches of Ilessia, Lastelle has a reputation for peace and quiet. The region in general has fewer small towns and cities, with much of its population packed into a few centers with a lot of open, often-frozen space between them. Many areas of the Lastellan region are covered in snow from mid-autumn to late spring, although the city itself is in the more temperate southern portion of the region. The city of Lastelle is the smallest of the Big Five, covering a bit less land than Verdania and containing a bit of a smaller population than Estruan. The Estruan region is bordered by mountains on the east and west, and much of the terrain is rolling hills leading up to the sheer cliffs of the northern coast. There's a palpable sense of isolation in Lastelle, even in the city where the hills can separate the districts, especially when the land slumbers beneath a blanket of snow.

  Lastelle is a land of faith and science working side by side. It is the most religious city and region in Ilessia, with the Arch-Faith being the most popular by a modest margin (the fact that one of the greatest of Arch's churches \- the Shining Cathedral, led by the High Priest Germaine Thorn \- is located in Lastelle may have something to do with that). However, it's also one of the biggest scientific centers in the country. What the Lastellan region is missing in smaller towns and cities, it makes up with isolated scientific facilities, wayside shrines, and even the occasional cloistered monastery dotting the terrain.

  Lastelle tends to be a place of contemplation and reflection. Writers and poets have been known to travel to the northern city to focus on their work, and more than a few celebrities have secondary (or tertiary) homes here where they can enjoy some measure of privacy. This isn't to say nothing happens in Lastelle \- aside from huge holiday celebrations, the so-called Quiet Place is known for its thriving night life. Clubs, bars, private parties, and the like offer a tremendous variety of nightly entertainment. Lastelle has also earned a reputation for exquisite cuisine, and some of the countries most highly-recommended restaurants can be found there.

  Almost every city in the Lastellen region boasts a well-respected university, and students from all over the country compete for acceptance to Lastellan schools. The city of Lastelle boasts three major universities and a sizeable student population. All three are extremely well-respected institutions, but one stands undeniably above the rest \- IDEA's world-renowned Elderage College.

  The people of Lastelle enjoy their peace and their privacy, but the isolation of the city can come with a cost. While the organized crime in the city isn't as well known as in some of the other major cities in the country, it does exist. Smaller scale crime is the bigger problem though. It's way too easy for an enterprising criminal to use the privacy of Lastelle against its citizens, and with how artists, celebrities, and students so often come and go, people can vanish without a trace and not be recognized as missing for weeks or even months. Although the city keeps it quiet to the public, among law enforcement, it's well established that Lastelle has a terrifying history of attracting serial killers.

  **The Assembly in Lastelle:** The Assembly has...somewhat muted operations in Lastelle. Quiet Places aren't exactly the sort of place where the Assembly thrives. They do their thing, sure, but probably their biggest function in Lastelle is setting up vacations for Dreamer celebrities looking for some peace and quiet to recharge. In this way, the Assembly actually takes on something of a inverse role from their usual aims \- rather than playing the media and generating buzz, they work to give their clients the rest and relaxation they're looking for, taking care of things so they can enjoy their rest.

  The regional base in Lastelle actually has a particularly large roster for the city's size, tending towards some fifty Heroes on call at once. However, usually better than half of them are newbies trying it out and learning the ropes, college students with Dreamer powers and a desire to become Heroes. The popularity of Hero Corps is imporant among the rather private populace of Lastelle; people tend to be more likely to report things to Hero Corps than the police, since Heroes tend to be less intrusive about things. The Heroes of Lastelle, thus, pride themselves on being able to quietly handle problems without disrupting peoples' lives. Naturally, the somewhat lower-glory operation is a large part of the reason that most of the novice Heroes head for other cities after they graduate. Lastellan Heroes tend to be the least interested in things like costumes and codenames, although since so many of their number are learning the ropes, they find things like statistics and ranking systems to be very important.

  The Regional Commander of the Lastelle Hero Corps is Yua Maki, Codename: Nano. Her Dreamer power is Technomorphism. PL 12+2.

  **SIDE in Lastelle:** For most of SIDE, there's not much to say about Lastelle. It's got about three Battle Squadrons worth of fighting power, but they do their job fairly normally. The big standout for Lastelle is TOP-SIDE. The TOP-SIDE Academy is housed in Lastelle. The Academy is not only respsonsible for training the next generation of TOP-SIDE officers, but it has elite training camps for officer training for all SIDE divisions. The Academy also works closely with IDEA to devise new tools, tactics, and protocols for maximizing the organization's effectiveness against Dreamer crime of all sorts. Much like Hero Corps, SIDE operations in Lastelle often have trainees working in the field, although always alongside more experienced SIDE agents.

  **IDEA in Lastelle:** IDEA has a huge presence in Lastelle and its outlying region. Many of the IDEA's most risky experiments (which is saying something) are conducted in isolated laboratories and facilities deep in the frozen Lastellan wilderness, well away from civilization. As noted above, Elderage College is set in Lastelle, and all IDEA departments have substantial holdings in the city. The DOS and the DPS both have extensive research facilities in Lastelle. Lastellan IDEA scientists have a strong rivalry with Braizen scientists, although more than a few have been known to head further north to study the wondrous Braizen radiation.

  Unfortunately, the same traits that make Lastelle a magnet for serial killers applies equally to Dreamcatchers. The statistics on Dreamers mysteriously vanishing from Lastelle never to be seen again would be horrifying...if they were better publicized.

  **The Reclaimers in Lastelle:** The Reclaimers tend to be viewed as kinda *annoying* in Lastelle. Remember, privacy is kinda a big thing here, and the Reclaimers aren't exactly known for minding their own business. That aside, though, the really noteworthy feature of the Reclaimers in Lastelle is the Repentant. The Reclaimers have several facilities \- a few in the city itself, others in the wilderness \- to contain Repentant Dreamers who fear their powers are a threat to others. The Reclaimers do catch some flack from these \- often from the Assembly questioning just how many "secret Dreamer prisons" they have going in the unregulated wilds of Lastelle. Although the real concern is the rumors that some of these facilities don't always receive all the food and supplies that they need, especially in the middle of the often-frozen, highly-isolated Lastellan wilderness.

  **Big Dreams in Lastelle:** While Big Dreams has its usual share of businesses and networking operations in Lastelle, its big focus in the region is on the universities. Big Dreams has regular recruiting drives, job fairs, and internships for Dreamer students at the Lastellan universities \- *especially* Elderage College. They're also a major provider of scholarships and financial aid for Dreamers looking to attend prestigious colleges, and they supplement the universities with their own privately-operated trade schools. Beyond all that, Lastelle is a common destination for Big Dreams business seminars.

  **Ilessia**

  **![][image8]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Responsibility  
  *Population:* 1 Billion (1% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* A (Mech, Nuke, Kill Sat, Special: Heroes)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 9/10

  Occupying the northern half of the continent of Aldonis, Ilessia is a large, powerful, fully modernized nation. Possessing one of the most advanced and powerful militaries in the world (second only to Haptarus, and that's more a matter of sheer numbers than military advancement), Ilessia is a potent and active force in world politics. Of all the nations of the world, Ilessia is the one whose culture the other nations are probably most familiar with, as they produce a massive amount of entertainment media that is consumed worldwide. Beyond that...well, Ilessia's kinda the nosy neighbor of the world, a little too happy to poke into everyone else's business. This isn't necessarily a bad thing \- they're one of only two non-Indelan nations who are actually involved in the war with Haptarus, for example, and they frequently send aid or relief to nations that need it \- but they can overstep their bounds at times, which can be a little scary for a nation with their military might.

  Ilessia has a President and a hundred-seat Senate, both popularly elected by majority vote. The governing power is largely divided between them, with the President capable of making Decrees that must be followed, while the Senate makes laws that preclude certain actions. The President's power, however, is worked primarily through its Delegates, each of which has responsibility for a certain section of the government.

  Ilessia is, if anything, a somewhat Dreamer-obsessed nation. It has several major organizations that are in one way or another focused on Dreamers, both in and out of government. Many Dreamers are treated as celebrities \- and a large number actually *are* celebrities, fueling the country's entertainment media machine.

  Ilessia is currently at war with Haptarus, and has a strong alliance (and friendly rivalry) with Limbra that has lasted several centuries, although the two countries were regularly at war before that. They have generally positive relations with most other countries.

  Perhaps the most internationally recognizable people of Ilessia are its Heroes. The organization called the Assembly of Dreams maintains an elite group of give-or-take a thousand Dreamers throughout (and some outside) the country, who use their powers as a sort of first-response team to deal with disasters, hostile Dreamers, and other problems. They aren't an official government organization, but they are extremely popular throughout most of the country and, honestly, beyond. In recent years, some Heroes have begun to take their good work abroad, and they are often welcomed with open arms by those nations they visit. Some of them really play up the whole superhero routine, with costumes and codenames and so on. While every country has its Dreamers that use their power to do good work, none of them have a force as cohesive, popular, and powerful as Hero Corps.

  And it's worth noting, Heroes aren't necessarily the most individually powerful Dreamers (although they're often used as the Gold Standard by which other Dreamer combatants are judged \- to say a Dreamer is Hero-level is to say it is a seriously powerful combatant), but the thing is...they have a tendency to overcome odds that by all rights should be beyond them. This isn't something that can be scientifically measures or statistically analyzed. It's not a matter of power, or gear, or Spiritual Energy. But Heroes, by whatever quirk of fate or providence, seem to be able to win even when the odds say they shouldn't.

  Well, it's to make a point. See the above overview? It's your basic detail of some of the points of the nation that stands out. Enough to give you a few details to work with on what Ilessia is like and what separates them from other nations. In short, it's the same treatment as all the other nations in this section get.

  **And it's missing a ton\!**

  Hero Corps gets some info, because Heroes are the Special military bit of Ilessia. The Assembly gets mentioned and the other organizations get alluded to, but there's nothing on SIDE and IDEA and the Reclaimers. No discussion of registration, Hostile Power Use laws, law enforcement, political parties, religion, or for that matter any of the things that aren't even in the above, much more detailed documentation on Ilessia. So when reading these nation summaries, *keep this in mind*. They are overviews. Extremely broad, extremely basic overviews of the big points and individual cool special stuff of these nations. They are not anywhere close to comprehensive.

  Occupying the southern half of the continent of Aldonis, Limbra is a staunch ally and perhaps stauncher rival of Ilessia. While the two nations have had a history of warfare, they have been allies for several centuries now. Limbra is every bit as technologically advanced as Ilessia (they, in fact, would say they are *more* advanced, and indeed their computer technologies in particular are probably the best in the world, although Ilessia definitely has the edge in vehicular and weapons tech).

  Limbra's government is an elected Parliament of five-hundred seats. Each representative can serve in up to two ten-year terms. Every two years, an election is held to fill a hundred seats. Each citizen may cast a vote for one candidate in one political party. The number of seats filled by that political party is proportionate to the number of votes that party received, and the representatives who fill those seats are the ones with the highest vote totals within that party.

  The President is elected every four years, by the Parliament. The majority party selects a minimum of six candidates, voting among themselves to determine the options. All *other* parties then vote to determine which is chosen. The President is mainly an executor of Parliamentary decrees and a public face of the government, but does have certain powers for emergencies, war, and other situations where a rapid government response is required. The President's primary power, though, is in hiring, promoting, and managing high-level members of other governmental bodies, such as directors of various government agencies, judges, the top levels of the military, and so on.

  Limbran Parliament is notorious for their long, elaborate, thorough debate processes. They actually keep the bureaucratic snags and delays to a respectable minimum, but any time saved thereby is more than made up for by their extensive decision-making process. Just in general, Limbra tends to be a cautious actor on the world stage, and favors a policy of non-intervention in most circumstances.

  Limbra is in some ways both a more and less Dreamer-friendly nation than Ilessia. They have much stricter laws regarding power use and more limitations on businesses to prevent a single Dreamer from entirely replacing a workforce. One thing they noticeably lack is large-scale Dreamer-centric organizations like Ilessia has. Sure, some units of the police or military might have training or equipment specialized for dealing with Dreamers, some scientists may focus on Dreamers and Dreamtech, some politicians may be more pro- or anti-Dreamer, and so on, but they don't have huge and hugely-government-funded organizations like SIDE or IDEA, or extremely influential Dreamer-centric groups like the Assembly or the Reclaimers. Dreamer-related things tend to be handled on a much more case-by-case basis.

  Limbra's major claim to fame is their computer technology, in particular their Matrix, an extensive, full-sensory virtual reality setup for navigating computer systems. Officially, the Limbran Matrix is limited to computers connected to the Matrix system, which are mostly operating in Limbra itself (there are some hubs in other countries with limited-to-varying-degrees Matrix access). However, Matrix programming can dynamically mod other systems in by normal connection processes...and with the right programs and know-how, you can access those connections within the Matrix. Primarily, the Matrix is a tool for rapid computer-related work \- subjective time spent in the Matrix goes by much more slowly than time outside, and the VR elements allow for intuitive navigation of systems. It's also used recreationally through various simulations, games, and so on.

  But oh yes, the Matrix absolutely has dangerous potential. Masters of working the Matrix (often referred to as technomancers) can do wild things within the virtual world, and have an amazing ability to access and manipulate other systems they connect to. By influencing how the program defines the systems it connects to, and then manipulating their capabilities within the program, a lot of lesser computer securities can be overcome with comparative ease. Consider, for example, a system whose firewall manifests as a solid brick wall...and is then wailed on by a technomancer whose virtual avatar possesses superhuman strength. There are Matrix-oriented programs that can protect systems from hostile technomancers, but they are naturally rather rare outside of Limbra. Dreamer technopaths, however, have proven able to project into the Matrix and combat technomancers on an even field. The capabilities of the Matrix and technomancers to attack and affect systems not intentionally connected to the Matrix is a closely-guarded secret, with such attacks generally assumed to be mundane hacking. However, a DC 30 Technology check could allow a character to recognize a cyber attack as Matrix-powered.

  **Paradisia**

  **![][image10]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Separation  
  *Population:* 30 Million (99.99% Dreamer)

  *Wealth Rating:* 9/10  
  *International Reputation:* D

  A huge island (or small continent, depending on how you look at it) raised from the ocean by the combined powers of the Better World Institute, Paradisia is a homeland for Dreamers.

  The country of Paradisia and the organization the Children of Paradise are two different things, although there's a lot of overlap. The Children of Paradise are responsible for the creation of Paradisia, but at the end of the day, they are an organization of Dreamers that are devoted to the idea of Dreamer separation. You don't have to be a card-carrying member of the Children of Paradise to be a Paradisian, and you don't have to live on Paradisia to be a Child of Paradise (in fact, a majority of the Children of Paradise *don't* live on Paradisia full-time, since their main goal is convincing Dreamers to separate and helping them to do so, which you can't do very effectively from the place where Dreamers go to be separated\!)

  As a matter of national law, Paradisia considers all Dreamers to be Paradisian citizens. It is up to them whether they retain their citizenship to their prior nation, but all Dreamers are considered to have the protection of Paradisia as if they were native citizens. How seriously the international community (and international Dreamers themselves) take this stance...varies.

  Paradisia is not a particularly popular nation, with a strong and not entirely undeserved reputation for xenophobia, espousing Dreamer supremacy, and the like. Coastal regions in particular have not forgiven them for the enormous damage caused by the raising of Paradisia fifty-two years ago \- East Luren, Gil, and Fasus, in particular, while not actively at war with Paradisia, treat them as an enemy nation and have no diplomatic relations with them. Just in general, Paradisia is something of a wildcard on the international stage, not dependent in the least on trade, and possessing something of a tendency to send people to foreign countries when they deem Dreamers in peril. Of course, since their whole point is to separate themselves from the rest of humanity, Paradisians only care so much about their international relations.

  Paradisia is governed by a Council of twenty. In practice, each Councillor has a scope of powers fairly similar to an Ilessian Delegate. However, there is no separate Senate, nor a President or other chief leader who has the final say on things. Each Councillor essentially has complete discretion in its field, but by majority vote the rest of the Council can veto an executive action by another Councillor. So, for example, the Councillor of War could declare war on another nation, but if a majority of the other Concillors voted against it, the declaration would be nullified. Councillor actions are *not* voted on automatically, but any Councillor can call for a vote on any action. There is also a core of regulations that the Council must follow, limiting their powers, which can be amended by unanimous Council vote. The Council is elected by popular vote, using a points-based system (each voter can assign each candidate points from \-2 to \+5, with the highest point total getting the seat) and they serve indefinite terms, but votes to retain or change Councillors are held yearly.

  Paradisia is effectively Dreamer-exclusive, something they catch a *lot* of international flak for. Paradisia has a reputation for splitting families apart, as they only accept Dreamer immigrants, and while children born on Paradisia do seem vastly statistically likely to become Dreamers themselves, those who do not will eventually be sent back to Mundane society. The only non-Dreamers who are welcome on Paradisia are ordained Seekers of the Dream.

  Paradisia may be a rather haughty name, but it does its best to live up to it. The island is an absolute picture-perfect tropical paradise. While it's fairly small, its population is smaller still and its city design is incredibly light. Space-warping powers are used for buildings, allowing them to take up minimal space and offering exceptional security. Roads are nonexistent, because the populace can fly or teleport where they need to go (see the Paradisian Aura section). As a result, Paradisia's towns and cities are designed more for aesthetic appeal than practicality. The practicality is built in.

  Paradisia's military strength is difficult to quantify. It's hard to declare anything a "typical Paradisian soldier", since they all have their own Dreamer powers. You can bet, though, that any serious Paradisian militant has either sufficiently potent gifts or enough training in the use of weaker ones to present at least a PL 8 threat, with PLs of 10 or 12 far from uncommon. Of course, even Paradisian citizens may be capable of entering combat on behalf of their land or their community if pushed to it \- do not make the mistake of assuming that just because a given Paradisian has not enlisted in the military, that it isn't potentially capable of presenting a Hero-level threat.

  **Peral**

  **![][image11]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Individualism  
  *Population:* 2 Billion (1.5% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* A- (Kill Sat, Special: Totems)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 5/10  
  *International Reputation:* B+  
  *Chief Import:* Energy  
  *Chief Export:* Agriculture  
  *Colors:* Green, Silver, and Red.  
  *Flag:* Three evenly spaced I symbols (vertically centered, positioned at 25%, 50%, 75% on the X axis) on a deep green background. The left and right symbols are red, the center one silver.

  Peral is generally considered a single country, but that's not particularly true. Peral is a large continent covered with hundreds of independent city-states, thousands of small essentially feudal towns, and tens of thousands of tiny independent ranches, farms, forts, keeps, castles, homesteads, and other plots of claimed land. Peral has much more limited access to technology than most modern countries, for several reasons. For one, Peral is very spread out, and its culture puts a premium on independence. There is no central government of Peral (the city-state of Acedon offers the *closest thing to it*, and represents the continent as a whole internationally, but its authority only goes so far). This means the sort of infrastructure that is necessary for large-scale energy generation, transport, and containment simply isn't available on a large enough scale.

  The people of Peral also don't really *care* that much for modern conveniences. They're a tough, proud, and fiercely independent culture, and see such luxuries as largely unnecessary. This isn't to say they reject technology out of hand, but it's rarer and generally less advanced than you see throughout most of Aranth. Peralans still have fuel-efficient cars, satellite-covered cell phones, and fast computers. But they don't have many flying cars or Active Crystal Computer Stations. Their weaponry tends to be less advanced \- your typical Perallan soldier would be equipped with what other countries consider professional-grade weaponry, rather than military-grade. And of course, energy is comparatively scarce. A Peralan isn't likely to burn the energy needed to power its car when it can walk to the store, or air condition its home when it can open the windows.

  And while it might be possible for other countries to step in and help modernize Peral...none of them have. Perallan foodstuffs are in high demand throughout the world, and the trade of energy for fine Perallan meats, fish, and produce is a booming global industry. So too, the fact is that a unified Peral would would the single most populous nation in the world, and possessed of a...uniquely strong population. No, an energy-independent Peral, while a fine and noble idea, is not actually something the other nations of the world particularly desire.

  And none of this is to say that the Peralans are suffering. Sure, hard times can fall on them somewhat more easily than in other countries, but Peral is, in fact, by far the countinent with the most natural resources of the entire planet. From an abundance of natural flora and fauna, to seemingly inexhaustible mines, to rich soil that consistently yields some of the finest produce in the world \- there is, simply, no competition between a freshly grown Perallan fruit or vegetable and one conjured up by matter-generation technology. The huge continent's natural resources are plentiful enough, and its people knowledgeable enough of managing their consumption, that it could probably feed the majority of the planet if it needed to. There is no denying that there is a certain energy, a natural vibrancy, to the continent of Peral \- which factors heavily in the shamanic traditions that are the continent's primary religion. Regardless of any mysticism, it is statistical fact that life, plant and animal alike, flourishes unusually strongly in Peral. Its natives are some of the most naturally gifted athletes on the planet, setting the bar for what is considered the peak of (unpowered) human physical achievement. And because of its size and shape, Peral extends through the full range of climates and ecosystems, from the tropical jungles of the north to the sweeping plains and vibrant forests of its central heartlands to the massive, snow-topped mountains of its southern reaches. The continent is a favored vacation spot for tourists and adventurers of all kinds \- and even now, some daring souls strike out to stake their own claim of land.

  But visitors should tread with care, for there is one other reason that a proper continent-spanning infrastructure has never been successfully set up in Peral.

  Here There Be Monsters.

  Whatever it is that makes Peral such a naturally rich land also means that it contains a variety of natural dangers far beyond anything the other continents can claim. Its plethora of normal animals, including all manner of deadly predators, is impressive enough. But there are also huge, ancient, and terrifyingly powerful beasts that live out in the Perallan wilds. While not in any way supernatural, these animals can be extremely fierce and superhumanly physically capable, potentially reaching Power Levels of 12 or more on raw physical prowess alone, although such powerful specimens are astonishingly rare. Still, PL 6 and even 8 animal encounters are far from impossible for one who wanders too far from civilization \- or who simply is unlucky enough to be in a civilization too close to the lair of such a creature when it gets hungry.

  These powerful creatures play an important role in Perallan shamanic traditions even to this day, and there are powerful and scientifically-confirmed shamanic rites involving them. Through these rites, it is possible to create a link to such an animal, making it into a Totem, to a variety of possible effects. These rites, though, are neither simple nor safe. In all cases, they involve the Hunter seeking out such an animal, alone, and bearing *only* tools and objects which it has crafted with either its own hands, or with other tools so formed. The use of any other item, the assistance of any other individual, or, it has been determined, the use of Dreamer powers in the effort, will cause the rite to fail. The Hunter must confront the beast, and face it in a manner befitting the rite. There are several, but the three most common are:

  *The Feast:* The Hunter kills the Totem, and feasts upon it, absorbing some of its strength (and, modern science believes, its Spiritual Energy). The Hunter's physical prowess is permanently augmented. It is possible to perform such a rite multiple times, but the boost seems to be a sort of "average" between the Hunter and the Totem, so the stronger you get, the stronger a Totem you need to Hunt to receive an increase.

  *The Offering:* The Hunter kills the beast, but then \- while the kill is still fresh \- must offer it to a second beast which it wishes to take as a Totem. If the Totem accepts the offering, a spiritual bond is formed between it and the Hunter. The strength and effects of this bond can vary. Some Hunters receive certain mental or perceptual augmentations related to the Totem. For some, the Totem actually follows them as a pet or companion. In some cases, typically only among those with very high amounts of spiritual energy (Dreamers, or very experienced Hunters who have performed many Rites of the Feast), the Hunter may even gain the ability to supernaturally summon the Totem and direct its actions.

  *The Sacrifice:* Easily the rarest rite, and one that few Hunters truly set out to perform. But a Hunter who is ritually prepared may, in the course of its hunting, come upon two great beasts in battle. If it aids the weaker one, and between them they defeat the stronger one, and the Hunter *loses its life* in or as a result of the effort, it is *possible* (not anywhere close to guaranteed) that the rite will bond the Hunter's spirit to the Totem it rescued. Again, the strength of the bond can vary. In most cases, the Totem only gains a certain measure of intelligence and empathy from the Hunter \- there have been many reports of Perallan families whose members died on a Hunt, only for great beasts to come to lair near their home and even rise to their defense when threatened. But, again in the case of those with especially high amounts of spiritual energy, it's possible for the Hunter to take full mental control of its Totem, somehow possessing and living on through it. Some such Hunters can even speak normally in their new body, or even shapeshift back and forth between their original form, and their bestial one.

  **The Braizen Isles**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Independence  
  *Population:* 100 Million (0.3% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C- (Special: Mutants)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 5/10  
  *International Reputation:* D  
  *Chief Import:* Waste Materials  
  *Chief Export:* Energy  
  *Colors:* None universal.  
  *Flag:* None universal.

  So, Aranth isn't really the sort of world where megalomaniacal supervillains plot global destruction from their isolated island volcano bases in the middle of treacherous arctic waters.

  But if it were, the Braizen Isles are where you'd find them.

  I'm not saying they're actually there. I'm just saying they would be. If they existed. Which they Very Probably Might Not.

  Ahem.

  The Braizen Isles are cold, isolated, and...not particularly fond of other nations. This is largely because of how the other nations of the world have treated them for several centuries. Let's talk history.

  The Braizen Isles do have a native population. Historically, they've lived in small, independent communities, often migrating between the various islands for reasons of supplies or to avoid hazards like the not-infrequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. Permanent settlements on the Braizen Isles are a relatively recent development. Starting some five centuries ago, other nations started regularly sending exiles to the Braizen Isles. A couple centuries ago, testing of nuclear, radiation, chemical, and similar technologies was often done on "unpopulated" islands...without much thought put into the fallout of these tests and the fact that Braizen communities were nomadic and an island that was empty one year might be home to thousands another year. This was not assisted by various waste dumping practices in the world's less ecologically-friendly days, a substantial portion of which led, due to ocean currents, to the Isles. Add in an experimental prototype for Paradisia about a century ago, and you have a melting pot of nomadic tribes wandering among unstable experimental energies and chemicals, heavy geomantic activity, a degrading prototype Aura, and, heck, toss in the Aurora Borealis for good measure, it probably had an arbitrary effect due to sheer *glowiness* at some point.

  The result? The Pits. Starting a little over fifty years ago, several major volcanoes and an uncounted number of smaller volcanos, hot springs, tar pits, and the like have begun giving off strange radiations, often coinciding with the lava, water, or tar glowing with odd colors. These energies also seem to be absorbed by indiginous stone and metal from the region. Such materials can be left in or near the Pits to gather a charge of energy, which can be used as a power source or even as part of special forging processes to make objects that are stronger and sometimes carry random special abilities.

  The problem is, prolonged exposure to radiation from the Pits appears to cause random mutations in organic beings. Plantlife around the Pits become strange and psychadelic, and humans and animals with extended exposure mutate in unpredictable ways. Often, these mutations are simply strange, sometimes actively detrimental. But beneficial mutations have also been known to occur. Such mutations aren't generally on the same scale as Dreamer powers, but can result in superhuman physical attributes, special immunities, odd senses, and other primarily physical powers. Mental powers have also developed on occasion, but they are very rare and typically only low-end perceptual stuff like short-range mental communication, passive empathy, surface-level mind reading, mind-sensing, and so on. In many cases, these mutations also cause a substantial *loss* of Spiritual Energy, and many mutants must carry around charged minerals or periodically visit the Pits to survive. Continual exposure to the radiation tends to exacerbate the mutations, but the process is extremely random \- just because you got a beneficial mutation once doesn't mean it will improve directly, or that your next mutation will be beneficial. Many mutants suffer from a vastly shortened lifespan.

  Of course, Dreamers themselves seem to have their own rules for interacting with the Pits, which can weaken, improve, or change their powers in random ways, temporarily or permanently. There is one particular Pit, called the Pool of Dreams, which was a hot spring that was at the center of the proto-Paradisian experiment. Its waters shine like mother-of-pearl, and it is confirmed fact that any Dreamer who bathes in the pool *will* have its powers removed, weakened, augmented, or changed. But which will occur, and to what degree, is completely unpredictable.

  The volcanic Pits seem to fuel the Pits as a whole. Material dumped into them is consumed and fuels the weird energies. Hazardous or energetic materials seem to have a greater effect. As a result, the Braizen Isles now actively import the waste of other nations, using it as fuel for their own strange energy source. This *would* make them extremely wealthy, being able to literally transform trash to power, but the process of actually converting the Pit radiation to safe, usable energy is difficult and fairly slow. It isn't helped by the fact that the Braizen Isles have nothing in the way of a centralized government to build infrastructure, with Pits controlled by fortified communities built around them, or wealthy and powerful individuals who have claimed them. Conflict is frequent in the Isles; they are a no-man's land where natives, the descendents of exiles, and ambitious settlers seek to control these new and potentially powerful (but also extremely hazardous) resources. Permanent cities have sprung up around the major Pits, powered by the not-quite-limitless energies that are refueled by the city's own waste. Many of these cities are extremely modern and surprisingly comfortable despite their somewhat-haphazard, often-a-little-experimental technology, but their governments are rarely benevolent and the number of people sporting random mutations is a clear indication that the technology shielding their populations from their power sources are not perfect.

  Many denizens of the Isles make use of specialized technology powered by Pit radiation and designed to shield the user from the power source...assuming no mistakes are made and they are kept in good repair. This technology tends to be more haphazard and less refined than typical modern technologies, but can be quite effective for all that, depending on the skill of the designer and the strength of the power source. Meanwhile, the wilderness is inhabited my warped animals, nomadic populations trying to navigate their now much more dangerous land, mutants so warped by Pit radiation that they've been exiled from their communities, and adventurers looking to find an unclaimed (or, for the less ethical, only lightly-defended) Pit to stake a claim of their own.

  **The Dymaran Kingdoms**

  Collectively referred to as the Four Kingdoms, Dymara is a quiet, peaceful continent. The kingdoms of Dymara are the oldest nations in the world, having existed in more-or-less their current forms for over fifteen-hundred years. In that time, the four kingdoms have never gone to war with one another. This lasting peace was born out of an extremely tumultuous history; something like a century before the current kingdoms were established, the various nation-states that made up Dymara were locked in a bloody and terrible war, until a great queen was able to conquer the warring nations and establish a single kingdom in her name. She did this not through the strength of her army, but by personally challenging generals and rulers of other nations to single combat, while using her ever-growing army to guard against treachery or massed attacks, and force ever-more-reluctant fighters to accept her challenges. As her life drew to a close, she divided the kingdom up among her four children, who worked together to establish lasting alliances between their new realms, so that the terrible wars that had killed so many would never start up again. To this day, peace is enforced between the four sibling nations through both strong cultural connections and allegiances, and the certain knowledge that any ruler that should break the peace would be swiftly overrun by the other three.

  Another reason for this long-lasting peace is the deep-seated Dymaran concept of the Champion, as exemplified by Queen Dymara and codified by her children. Dymarans are strongly averse to clashes of vast armies. When the kingdoms came into conflict after first being established, rather than going to war, their rulers met with their siblings and worked the matter out. If a compromise could not be reached, the neutral rulers would propose a fair challenge between them, with their backing going behind the winner. This concept of personal discussion before a neutral party, followed by a challenge where compromise cannot be reached, is central to the Dymaran view of conflict resolution. Over time, this notion has evolved into several specific Trials which can be undertaken to resolve a matter on which a compromise cannot be reached, with the possibility of enlisting a Champion to undertake the Trial in a person's stead. The role of the Champion is important, because the Champion must itself be persuaded to assist you, and while wealth and favors can be a route for that, many of the finest Champions in the kingdom will refuse to help those they do not truly believe are in the right. While the truth of the matter is somewhat more muddled, the cultural perception, at least, is largely that the strength of a Champion is reflective of the rightness of the cause it fights for.

  Largely as a result of their peaceful history and emphasis on personal conflict resolution, the Dymaran nations do not have exceptional military strength in general. This is not to say they don't *have* militaries, but their budgets for them are nowhere near the level of, say, Aldonian or Indelan nations. Dymaran nations in particular tend to have substantially less modern military gear (typically only their elite soldiers have access to what other nations would consider military-grade weaponry, with most soldiers wielding professional-grade weapons). That said, the fighting power of Dymarans should not be discounted.

  The big reason for this is their understanding of chi. Chi is essentially the knowledge, awareness, and manipulation of the *flow* of spiritual energy within the body. Through physical and mental exercises and meditation, it is possible to develop a sufficiently strong chi to use spiritual energy to augment one's physical feats, and even to gradually increase one's spiritual energy over time. Strength of chi, however, is not something that is easily taught. There isn't a precise formulaic procedure for how to develop it; it's something that's a little different for everyone, and you kind of know it when you have it. The foundations are best learned in childhood; it's a lot harder for adults and even teenagers to quite notice when they've got it, and go with it when they do; it's way too easy to lose it by overthinking it. It is, of course, also a big help to have people who are themselves strong in chi around when you're learning, since they can give feedback on what seemed to be working and not. Resultantly, while chi is a skill that anyone can potentially learn, it is rather rare outside of Dymara, but nearly ubiquitous within.

  For no doubt extremely relevant, thoroughly scientifically understood reasons, though, some of both the main uses for chi and generally effective methodology for training it involves awesome martial arts feats and superhuman acts of parkourish acrobatic ability. Definitely...definitely a good, solidly grounded reason for that that is way too complicated and, you know, scientific and stuff to get into here. For sure.

  As a result, even your average Dymaran citizen is often surprisingly physically capable, able to focus their spiritual energy to move faster, jump higher, hit harder, and perform feats of prowess that almost seem to bend \- but not break \- the laws of physics. Truly gifted masters of chi, either those with great talent or those with vast experience, have personal volumes of spiritual energy that can rival Dreamers, and perform feats equivalent to mid-grade Dreamer powers. And of course, since chi is based on personal spiritual energy, Dymaran Dreamers tend to see a noticeable boost, and even Dreamers with weak powers can, due to the massive overabundance of spiritual energy Dreamers possess, perform chi-fueled feats that are blatantly superhuman, allowing even Dreamers with trivially weak powers potentially reach Hero-level or greater combat ability, and perform such amazing feats as directing their spiritual energy outwardly, using it to fly or teleport, and perform similar ~~shamelessly anime~~ *extremely scientifically plausible given the nature of chi and spiritual energy* feats.

  Dymara has its dark side though. Corruption is fairly prevalent through the mid-levels of government in all four Dymaran nations. Conflict resolution is a *personal* matter, and that means that personal solutions tend to be valid. A criminal whose family member is the local judge or who works in the governor's office or even the ruler's palace can get away with a lot. The Dymaran kingdoms also *are* kingdoms, with a strong and proud noble caste. Many noble houses trace their lines back centuries, and the web of social and political alliances and feuds is a complex and tangled thing. Members of the high nobility wield tremendous power. The royal families themselves actually do have a long tradition of benevolent rulership and are widely well-respected both at home and on the world stage, but they aren't immune to mistakes, oversights, or simply poor information. Social and political conflict, spying, and even assassination attempts all regularly occur at the higher ends of Dymaran government, with powerful nobles, military commanders, and bureaucratic directors all jockeying for royal favor.

  **Darpon:**

  **![][image13]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Honor  
  *Population:* 500 Million (1.2% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C+ (Mech, Nuke)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 6/10  
  *International Reputation:* A-  
  *Chief Import:* Weapons.  
  *Chief Export:* Textiles.  
  *Colors:* Silver and Gold.  
  *Flag:* A silver shield in the center of a gold background.

  Darpon is the most militaristic of the Dymaran kingdoms. They've long held the largest standing army and a strong warrior class. In recent times, they've been heavily expanding their military forces, both importing and developing more powerful weapons, training more soldiers, and otherwise trying to bring their military strength up closer to the level of heavy-hitters like Ilessia and Limbra. There is a certain cultural perception that they are the "big brother" of the Dymaran kingdoms. People of Darpon tend to have a strong national protectiveness of their sibling kingdoms, and Darpon is almost invariably the first in line to send aid when disasters strike the other Dymaran nations. Martial ability is highly respected here, and honor duels are a popular form of Trial even in the modern day.

  **Kyana:**

  **![][image14]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Organization  
  *Population:* 700 Million (1.2% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C- (Mech, Kill Sat)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 8/10  
  *International Reputation:* B  
  *Chief Import:* Machinery.  
  *Chief Export:* Medicine.  
  *Colors:* Silver and Blue.  
  *Flag:* A silver scroll in the center of a blue background.

  The most populous of the Dymaran nations, Kyana has a much more extensive government bureaucracy than the other nations. The southern third of the kingdom qualifies as an arctic region, so it's actually a fair bit more crowded than sheer square-footage would suggest. Kyana is also a more isolated nation than the others, not as active on the world stage. Their cultural reputation is of a people that largely keep to themselves and don't really bother anyone, but also aren't very open or friendly.

  **Leron:**

  **![][image15]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Inspiration  
  *Population:* 300 Million (1.2% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C- (Mech, Kill Sat)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 10/10  
  *International Reputation:* A-  
  *Chief Import:* Energy.  
  *Chief Export:* Art.  
  *Colors:* Silver and Yellow.  
  *Flag:* A silver quill in the center of a yellow background.

  The smallest of the Dymaran nations in terms of both size and population, and in many ways the polar opposite of Kyana. Leron is a warm-to-temperate kingdom with several beautiful vistas and a strong tourist economy. They are the wealthiest of the Dymaran nations as a whole, although their wealth is perhaps the least evenly distributed, with vast swaths of the population living in near-poverty while the big resorts, noble families, popular artists, studios, and producers, and so on living in tremendous luxury.

  **Veneil:**

  **![][image16]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Peace  
  *Population:* 500 Million (1.2% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* D (Mech, Kill Sat)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 8/10  
  *International Reputation:* A+  
  *Chief Import:* Agriculture.  
  *Chief Export:* Food.  
  *Colors:* Silver and Green.  
  *Flag:* A silver goblet in the center of a light green background.

  Veneil is probably the single most well-respected nation on the world stage. They cultivate peaceful and positive ties with almost every other nation on the planet. And beyond that...well, here's the thing you have to understand about Veneil. They are probably the strongest believers in the Dymaran ideal of peace. They have the smallest military budget of all of the already not particularly militant Dymaran kingdoms. They are not a powerful kingdom, combatively-speaking. And they are the only non-Indelan nation on the planet other than Ilessia that has stepped up to the plate and officially declared war on Haptarus. And this is not just some formal, make a statement declaration. Veneil has sent combat troops to Indelar on multiple occasions, and they have at least one mech dedicated to the war \- and rumor is, one of the king's children is on the front lines piloting it.

  **The Empire of Haptarus**

  **![][image17]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Dominance  
  *Population:* 1.2 Billion (0.5% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* S (Mech, Nuke, Kill Sat, Special: Blood Magic)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 8/10  
  *International Reputation:* F  
  *Chief Import:* Ill-will, the occasional missile, land  
  *Chief Export:* Hostile soldiers, the Emperor's rulership  
  *Colors:* Black and Red  
  *Flag:* A series of alternating black and red bars. The upper left corner of the flag are horizontal, the upper right corner diagonal going up, the lower left corner diagonal going down, and the lower right corner vertical.

  Let's make one thing clear off the bat. In a world that assumes nuance and interpretation, where the villains are usually just out for themselves and some Heroes are merely seeking wealth and fame, where most major organizations have ideals they strive for and deep flaws they try to hide, where virtually nothing can truly be said to be all good or all bad...

  The Emperor of Haptarus is unquestionably, unapologetically, and unrepentantly **evil**.

  Haptarus is a state that for the last thirty-seven years has terrorized its continent and terrified the rest of the planet. Its Emperor is a Grade A megalomaniacal supervillain, everybody knows it, and the only reason the entire planet has not banded together to destroy him is that most nations of the world range from completely terrified to healthily cautious of him and his Empire. Haptarus is, without question, the most militarily powerful nation in the world, and it has not gotten there by showing anything resembling compassion, mercy, or even basic conscience.

  Do not go looking for the mitigating factors here, for the reasonable argument from the other side. The best that can be said about Haptarus as an Empire is that its people are not entirely behind their Emperor ideologically. Vast numbers of Haptaran residents would flee or turn against their current government \- if they could.

  Haptarus is ruled (with an iron fist) by its Emperor. His given name is unknown; to the world, he is called only the Emperor, the Emperor of Haptarus, or simply Haptarus. He prefers the latter \- in his view, he *is* Haptarus, and would prefer that the rest of the world know it. The Emperor of Haptarus is a tyrannical ruler, with complete control over all of Haptarus, its assets, and its citizens. He rejects the idea of human rights on their face. It is known that he has a driving motivation to conquer and rule the entire continent of Indelar. Many fear that should he succeed, his designs would soon turn global, although he has in fact publically disavowed any such intention. He is also one of the most powerful Dreamers on the planet (PL 16+?) \- he is confirmed to have taken down mechs in single combat. His exact power set is unknown, and reports of his abilities are many and conflicting. Speculation abounds.

  The Haptaran military is roughly technologically equal to Ilessia's \- it's just much, much larger. Most citizens are compelled to serve in the military at least once in their lives, and on any given day it's a safe bet that a fifth of the Empire's adult population is on active military duty. That being said, most citizen and conscript soldiers are poorly-trained and equipped (PL 2-3), while professional soldiers still hit PL 5\. ALL Haptaran Dreamers whose powers have any value for it whatsoever are pressed into military service. Such Dreamers undergo rigorous, even torurous training, and the weaker ones often perish. But those who survive are showered with wealth and prestige, and possess exceptional personal power \- most Haptaran military Dreamers range from PL 9 to 12, with a sizable number hitting PL 11, and they often have powers equivalent to military-grade weapons. The vast majority of the Empire's economy goes to funding its military.

  Haptarus also possesses the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, but so far, has chosen not to engage in nuclear war, although the Emperor has been known to threaten it loudly when other countries get too uppity about what's going on in Indelar. This, more than perhaps anything else, is what keeps the rest of the world from uniting against the Emperor in force. That said, there is not a single country in the world that has an actual alliance with Haptarus. Ilessia and Veneil are both officially at war with Haptarus, although in Ilessia's case, it's more a war of supporting and defending the other countries of Indelar rather than an open conflict. In Veneil's case, the military support, while present, is far less a matter than trade \- Veneil is the single biggest source of supplies and foreign aid to the combat-embroiled countries of Indelar. That said, given the generally pacifistic nature of the Dymaran continent in general (and their correspondingly low military power), the fact that Veneil has declared itself an unmitigated enemy of a state as powerful as Haptarus and *has* sent combat forces against it has earned the country some major points for sheer audacity. Naturally, all remaining Indelan countries are at war with Haptarus, but the rest of the world's nations are officially neutral.

  Haptarus is strictly divided into a caste system. The various castes of the Empire are as follows:

  *The Emperor:* The Emperor stands in a caste all his own. He has absolute sovereignity in Haptarus. To defy his will is to die, unless you give him a good reason to spare you.

  *The Royal Caste:* The Emperor's family (that is, wives and children \- if he has any extended family, they are unknown, and it's strongly believed he killed them all as part of his rise to power), and his Speakers. They are extremely wealthy, powerful, and can basically do whatever they want if it doesn't conflict with the Emperor's will.

  *The Noble Caste:* Officially made up of loyal and trusted members of the Haptaran Nobility but in practice basically anyone the Emperor likes and trusts enough to assign to it \- Nobles generally run cities and are otherwise top-level commanders in specific areas. Again, wealthy, powerful, and generally living on top of the world as long as they keep the Emperor happy.

  *The Military Caste:* Strictly speaking, this is military *elites* and *officers* \- people who have dedicated their lives to the military. Generally the last caste to really receive the benefits of wealth and power. The high-level commanders, powerful Dreamers, eminent military scientists, and other people at the high-end of the caste basically get the Rock Star treatment. From there it trickles down, but even the lowliest military officer can generally be assured a comfortable life for itself and its family.

  *The Government Caste:* Low-ranking government officials. Bureaucrats, basically. Overworked, underpaid, unappreciated, but they can usually get by with a tolerable life as long as they keep their heads down and keep their little corner of Haptarus running smoothly. When they don't...well, there's a lot of talk of impromptu head explosions.

  *The Citizen Caste:* Normal people, but people who have declared loyalty to the Empire (and done nothing to have it called into question). Pretty much everything they do goes to the Empire, and the Emperor sees to it that they are provided with pretty much just enough to get by. If they don't like it, tough.

  *The Slave Caste:* Convicts, prisoners of war, citizens of conquered kingdoms who refused to swear loyalty to the Empire, traitors, or pretty much anyone the Emperor doesn't like. Anyone who is of no value to the Empire is also relegated to the Slave Caste, including people who would otherwise be Government or Citizen Caste but are too old, too young, infirm, handicapped, and so on. If they're physically capable, they're forced to work at physical labor jobs, energy generation, and so on, receiving no pay only the bare minimum sustenance required to keep them operating efficiently (~~fun trivia~~ horrifying scientific fact \- occasional spikes of intense feeling, such as pain, can improve energy generation by up to 15%\!) Otherwise, they're usually placed in important military bases to "make the bleeding hearts of other nations thing twice about bombing them". Those that are physically capable but refuse to work are generally sent to the front lines for use as human shields, or even tactically sent to other countries in "refugee waves" to gobble up some of their resources (hidden bombs or infection with contagious diseases optional, but encouraged). Finally, as if that all wasn't sufficiently evil, Haptaran ritualists are proficient at blood magic \- potent rituals augmented through the use of blood sacrifice.

  **The Free Nations of Indelar**

  The entire central portion of the continent of Indelar has been conquered by Haptarus, but the remaining fifteen nations are resisting the Empire's advance strenuously. The Free Nations of Indelar have put old grudges (mostly) aside and united against their common enemy. These are war-weary, battered countries, but the war hasn't consumed them entirely. Daily life still goes on, people still work and play and love. But they rarely truly *relax*.

  Aside from the war, there are few unifying facets to the various countries of Indelar. Their geographical proximity is not an indication of cultural similarity, and even before Haptarus, Indelar was a fairly conflicted region of the world. Even since the Awakening, regimes have risen and fallen occasionally, although the conflict had been steadily declining with the rise of a more connected international community \- again, until Haptarus.

  The remaining nations of Indelar are holding on against Haptarus, if only just. The fact is, the Empire is surrounded and has no source of external supplies. They're self-sufficient enough, but still, it matters. For the past couple years, the war in Indelar has been a tense stalemate. Haptarus is stretched so thin against the Free Nations that it hasn't been able to make serious headway, but the Free Nations are putting their all just into maintaining that state. There are weak links among them, and if Haptarus were to break one, the war could very quickly change.

  Perhaps the greatest advantage the Free Nations hold over the Empire is their Nulls. Nulls are simply a type of Dreamer, specifically with the ability to neutralize other Dreamer powers. But the thing is, in Indelar, they are *extremely* common. They are, in fact, the single most common manifestation of Dreamer powers in the Indelan nations, beating even such broad classifications as "physical augmentations" and "energy control" for that title. In most countries, the ability to neutralize Dreamer powers is just one of many types of Dreamer power, albeit a rare one. In Indelar, it's an entire class of Dreamer power. Most Nulls possess strong personal resistance to Dreamer powers, the ability to neutralize Dreamer powers actively. But from there, it branches out tremendously. Some can neutralize other classes of effects. Some can use the powers of those they nullify. Some can nullify certain natural forces. Likewise, some are more limited, only able to counter certain types of Dreamer powers or so on. Some powerful Nulls are completely immune to Dreamer powers (often both for good or ill), and even radiate such an immunity around them.

  **Anvar:**

  **![][image19]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Practicality  
  *Population:* 150 Million (0.7% Dreamer)

  *Flag:* A silver candle flame in each corner with a purple background.

  Anvar is a more-or-less autocratic country ruled by twelve Executives \- one for each major city in the country. Each Executive has virtually absolute power within its own city and its environs (there are some specific federal mandates agreed upon by the group that limit an Executive's power in its city \- for example, no Executive can *force* their citizens to stay in their city if they wish to move to a different one), and collectively they wield absolute federal power, but federal decisions require majority agreement (with certain extremely significant decisions requiring greater majorities), and are only for things that *must* involve the entire country. Matters such as resource allocation are divided among the Executives based on the population of their cities for them to utilize as they deem fit. The premise is that there will be little need for politicking among the Executives, leaving them to guide the country as they determine best with their collective knowledge and debating. When an Executive dies, retires, or is deemed by a 3/4 majority unfit for continued service, the Executives collectively choose a replacement. Once appointed, the position has no term limit.

  Although the Executives wield absolute power, since resources are determined by population, citizens have a certain amount of ability to "vote with their feet". The Executives compete to make their cities the most attractive to their citizens, and facilitate those who desire to move to their cities. The Executives are also surprisingly receptive to feedback for autocrats; while citizens don't have any actual legal power to influence their decisions, they do have a reputation for paying close attention to what their citizens want and taking their views and information into account. So far, the Executives have generally proved generally benevolent, if not particularly generous. The general view of them is "they'll do what is best for the country, and take as much of the profits for themselves as they can possibly get away with". Nonetheless, there are several countries that oppose the Executives' autocratic rule.

  Anvar is well known for the Union of Natural Improvement via Technology, or UNIT. UNIT is a rival of IDEA, which focuses on developing practical technology (sometimes from Dreamtech, sometimes not) that provides practical improvement to peoples' lives. UNIT was founded about a century before the Awakening, and during that century was the most renowned scientific institute on the planet, responsible for such inventions as cars, refrigerators, air conditioning, and even tupperware. It's lost a fair chunk of prestige to IDEA over the past century, but it's still competitive \- Active Crystal was originally designed by UNIT, among other things. Since the start of the war with Haptarus, UNIT is, for the first time in its history, working on developing military technology. There are more than a few people throughout the world who are just a little bit terrified of this.

  Anvar is slow to engage Haptarus militarily where they don't need to, contributing to the war effort through the development of technology where they can, although they make surgical strikes where strategically feasible. For their part, Haptarus is content to wage a war of attrition against Anvar, using infiltrators and saboteurs against them more often than massed troops. Their country isn't exactly the most fertile, and by targeting food stores and incoming supplies, they are slowly chipping away at their resolve and building tension between the cities and Executives as resources become imbalanced...

  **Dyburen:**

  **![][image20]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Happiness  
  *Population:* 200 Million (0.5% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* D (Kill Sat, Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 1/10  
  *International Reputation:* B-  
  *Chief Import:* Building Materials  
  *Chief Export:* None (formerly Technologies)  
  *Colors:* Pink and White.  
  *Flag:* Literally it's a smiley on a white background except the smiley is pink rather than yellow.

  For a long time, Dyburen's claim to fame was its schools. Not its colleges (although the University of Dyburen was very well-respected). But no country has ever so embodied the notion "our children are our future". Dyburen's biggest national investment, by far, was in its children and families. Ensuring children grew up happy, healthy, and well-educated was *the* biggest priority of the nation, bar none. And you know, it had an impact. Dyburen might not have had great scientific organizations like IDEA or UNIT, or amazing developments like Libra's Matrix or Gil's matter converters. But they had an extremely well-educated and heavily-motivated workforce that developed their share of impressive technologies. They were in many ways a counterpart to Anvar, responsible for many basic technologies that provided comfort, entertainment, and education over more practical functions. Dyburen will always be known as the country responsible for television.

  But that was before the war. These days, the national priority has been essentially shortened to "ensuring children grow up". And even that is a struggle.

  Dyburen has never been a military powerhouse, and Haptarus easily could have broken its military utterly. So far, they haven't. They've more-or-less ignored them, honestly, dedicating token forces to hold them off and otherwise rolling over them to get to other targets. Their industry and infrastructure has been shattered, and Dyburen still mourns the day Haptarus "declared war" on them \- by staging a blitzing daytime bombing raid not against their military or industry, but on their schools (historical note: it was this barbaric attack that prompted Ilessia to declare war against the Empire). Haptarus likely would have conquered them entirely if not for the aid of Endris...and the fact that over the ten years since, Haptaran military Dreamers who have dared entered the country have often been set upon at night by *packs* of unaging, undying, revenant Null children, completely immune to Dreamer powers, who have torn them apart with savage ferocity before vanishing into the shadows of the night. How many of these not-quite-undead children are out there, how their attacks are organized, and whether there is anything left of who they originally were, is all completely unknown.

  Despite the suffering they have endured, though, the people of Dyburen are still fighting, still surviving, and even though a majority of the country's families have lost at least one child, still holding to hope that one day the war will end and they will be able to rebuild. While they may not be able to provide much in the way of military or material support to the war effort, the Dyburen spirit and capacity for hope is an inspiration to all of Indelar.

  **East Luren:**

  **![][image21]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Freedom  
  *Population:* 100 Million (0.6% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* B+ (Nuke, Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 3/10

  *Colors:* Brown and Green  
  *Flag:* A brown hollow rectangle about 20% from the edge, on a green background.

  Up until almost two hundred years ago, Luren was a single nation, and for a long time one of the wealthiest in the world. This wealth came predominantly from oil, coal, and other biofuels, which Luren had one of the world's largest supplies of (in theory, Peral has a larger supply, but mining and drilling operations in Peral have...not been known to go swimmingly). But around \-100 PA, alternative forms of energy \- including nuclear power \- began developing, along with growing concerns about pollution and sustainability of biofuels.

  If you ask an East Lurener, the four-year civil war that began in \-65 PA was about a disenfranchised worker's class throwing off the oppressive regime of a corrupt government firmly in the pocket of big biofuel conglomerates. If you ask a West Lurener, it was a bloody rebellion triggered by panic and greed. End of the day though, the nation went to war, and in the end, was split more-or-less in half.

  While East Luren has continued to be a leading supplier of biofuels, they were also concerned with the shifting attitudes and growing concerns regarding it, and invested heavily in research and development of more renewable energy sources \- nuclear energy in particular. The situation was wavering but functionally stable through the second half of the last pre-Awakening century, but with the discovery of Spiritual Energy as yet another possible route energy supply, and the significant progress made with solar and geothermal energy in the early first century PA, worldwide consumption of biofuels began to sharply decline. The development of energy farms in 70 PA was more-or-less the final nail in the coffin.

  East Luren adapted to the times, phasing out its biofuel industries in favor of other exports and forms of energy generation more and more. It couldn't maintain its prior level of wealth, but wasn't impoverished or falling apart by any means. Then came the war with Haptarus. East Luren has prided itself on a strong military ever since the war of secession, so they've so far been able to hold their own capably against the forces Haptarus sends against them. However, Haptaran air strikes and saboteurs have been heavily prioritizing their nuclear and geothermal plants, cutting sharply into their energy resources. For the first time in decades, the old biofuel industries of Easy Luren have been kicking into gear to try to stem the loss of wealth and power from these attacks and keep their military in fighting shape. But everyone knows that's only a temporary solution \- against an enemy with the energy resources of Haptarus, the finite and inefficient power offered by East Luren's remaining supply of biofuels will not be able to hold for long.

  **Endris:**

  **![][image22]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Duty

  *Chief Import:* Energy

  *Colors:* Yellow, Orange, and Purple  
  *Flag:* A circle of eight alternating yellow and orange stars on a purple background.

  About three-quarters of the country of Endris is a rough, arctic region of high plateus, rocky crags, and sheer cliffs. The fields and farms of the lowlands, shielded from the worst of the arctic winds and storms by the mountains beyond them, are sufficiently fertile to feed the country with only modest supplement from trade, albeit only with extreme effort and skill from the tough, determined farmers who tend the land. About two-fifths of the population lives in the rural farmlands, with the rest in great plateu-top cities and small mountainside mining towns, many of which delve into expansive underground tunnels, some going deep enough to be warmed by the heat of the earth. The highlanders of Endris weather the bitter cold and regular blizzards with grit, stoicism, and ludicrously high heating bills.

  The highlanders of Endris have a reputation for keeping to themselves and being blunt and frank in their speech. The lowland farmers \- perhaps due in part to sharing a border with the historically friendly, cheerful people of Dyburen \- tend to be more open and welcoming, albeit still rather taciturn. In many ways, they consider themselves two entirely different cultures, but each with a duty to one another. The highlanders provide the metal needed for tools and the soldiers and fortifications necessary for defense (and, more recently, the majority of the country's domestic energy supply through their geothermal plants). The lowland farmers offer food, and the opportunity for respite when the arctic winters become too harsh (although as technology has advanced this bit has become more of a luxury than occasional necessity).

  While even before Haptarus Indelar was far from a conflict-free nation, Endris and Dyburen have always had a friendly relationship, and in fact the Endris-Dyburen border has the distinction of the only Indelan border that has never seen war, a claim that both nations take a great cultural pride in. Endris is the only Indelan nation in the modern day whose border is not exposed at all to Haptarus \- but this does not mean they have stayed out of the war. They have been sending military support to Dyburen from Haptarus' first attack upon them, and have accepted tens of thousands of Dyburen refugees, with plans underway to take in the entire country if it becomes necessary. For now, they are the shield that is keeping Dyburen from collapsing. Haptarus has not directly assailed them yet \- although the Emperor eagerly awaits the day that Dyburen falls so he can break the Endris border's streak of peace, and has big plans for sweeping through and annihilating the lowland farms. Military engagement of mountain cities shielded from air assault by arctic winds and storms would be difficult of course...but Haptarus is interested to see what will happen when the country is forced to divide its only mediocre energy supply between matter generation for food, and power for heat.

  **Fasus:**

  **![][image23]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Growth  
  *Population:* 200 Million (0.5% Dreamer)

  *Colors:* White, Green, and Black.  
  *Flag:* Four green stars around a black ring on a white background.

  The country of Fasus is a temperate land of deep forests, rocky hills, and sandy beaches. Its people have a deep cultural respect for ideals of adventure and exploration, embodied by the early settlers to the land who carved their holdings out from the often-difficult wilderness. Over time, what began as a few small logging towns had spread to become a thriving nation. Though Fasus has reached the limits of its landspace, the country has continued to grow in other ways \- namely, up. Fasus is the architectural capital of the world, featuring complex and detailed building designs, creative layouts, and, especially in recent years, ambitiously high skyscrapers, made possible by the country's world-renowned building materials and proprietary antigravity stabilization technology. Seven of the world's ten tallest buildings are in Fasus, and the country's five major cities have breathtaking skylines, towering above the thick forests that surround them. Between the cities the woods are dotted with quaint, picturesque towns and villages.

  Though far from the wealthiest nation on the planet, Fasus does in fact produce quite a bit more energy than its overall wealth suggests \- the huge buildings and antigravity stabilizers are expensive to maintain. The antigravity technology is used in more than just buildings \- every modern car in Fasus is a flying vehicle, a fact which has allowed them to clear the old network of roads that once crisscrossed their forest. Though the prior locations of the roads are still apparent by the young trees that fill them, nature is already well on its way to reclaiming them.

  Fasus has plans to create the world's first floating city, but so far, the energy costs and logistical challenges have been prohibitive, and the war with Haptarus has not helped matters. But the project is a source of national pride, and a major political topic. Fasusan culture strongly encourages what they call *adolatry* \- the most literal translation might be "humble ambition", although that doesn't quite do it justice. A sense of ambitious self-confidence without pride, a drive to seek to do great things without convincing yourself that *you* are great \- and always, always knowing that you can be better, and your dreams bigger.

  Fasus is a steadfast enemy of Haptarus, and have recently been heavily stepping up weapons imports and military spending to better combat the Empire. Although not the *most* aggressive of the Indelan nations (that honor goes unquestionably to Shul), they focus almost as much on offense as defense. Defeating the Empire is a lofty goal for sure, and Fasus is not a nation known for turning down a challenge. For his part, the Emperor sees conquering a Fasusan city as a personal treat \- two have fallen to his forces, and both times he arrived personally in the aftermath. As he once put it, "It's like a cross between billiards and dominoes. Only with bowling. *Only with buildings\!*"

  **Gil:**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Progress

  *Flag:* A gold lion in a red square on a white background.

  Gil is, by far, the wealthiest nation in the world. Full stop.

  Let's be absolutely clear here. They have a tenth the population of Ilessia, and probably like ten times the total wealth. And yes, that absolutely means the average Gilean income per-capita is give-or-take a hundred times that of Ilessia. The Gilean equivalent of "lower-middle-class" is "non-millionaire". *And they have a very small lower-middle class\!* This is not a "massive amounts of money in the hands of a small elite while the majority of the citizens kinda do okay" situation. The wealth isn't *evenly* distributed, sure, but it's definitely *well* distributed. The typical child's *allowance* in Gil could outstrip some decently-paying jobs in many other countries. "But inflation\!" you say. No. Sorry. Gil *killed* inflation. They *threw money at it until it died* and then *buried the corpse under their massive piles of money*\!

  How can this be? Well, Gil's always been up there on the wealth scale just because the country has always been rich in precious stones and metals. But that alone isn't what got the country to where they are today. No no, *that* came about through their matter converter technology. Like matter generators in reverse, these wondrous pieces of absolute bleeding-edge Dreamtech are able to convert matter into energy. They're not as efficient as matter generators are expensive \- if you try to create matter from energy and then convert it back to energy, you operate at a loss \- and the type of matter does have an impact. Crude materials, and most biological materials, are very inefficient, only producing maybe a twentieth to a tenth of the energy it would take to create an equivalent amount of mass. Water comes in at like 1%. Biofuels are decent in the sense that they'll output their full energy capacity (in terms of the fuel they can provide, not the energy required to create them) and in a much cleaner way than burning them would do. Metals and elements tend to be more efficient, with precious metals and gemstones tending in the 90-95% efficiency range and remember where Gil got its original wealth from? Yeah. It's actually reached the point where Gil, who had once sold its precious metals and stones to other countries for a profit, are now able to buy them back for something like double their market value, and convert them to something like ten times their market value as energy (matter generators don't usually produce precious stones and metals, since they're expensive to create, not super-useful, and their main value *is* their rarity so creating them in bulk doesn't help anyone). Since they also have matter generators of their own, which are themselves a bit ahead of the curve technologically, yeah, Gil is entirely post-scarcity. Anything they can't generate themselves, they can trivially buy from other nations. This is also part of how Gil killed inflation. They don't buy and sell goods among themselves. If they want to buy something, they go to some *other* country to get it. Most Gilean labor is automated \- they have one of the largest numbers of robots of any country in the world, and by far the most robots per-capita.

  This tremendous access to energy is then leveraged for even greater effective wealth by investing in various international companies or even entire countries. Gileans have been known to go on random weekend vacations to other nations, find some small business they like (maybe they eat at a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant and really like the food, or go to some manner of entertainment that they enjoy), and just kinda arbitrarily invest tens or hundreds of thousands or even millions of credits in the business to "take it to the next level", just because they can.

  Gil is not a popular country on the world stage. Aside from general envy (and the fact that a lot of people find Gileans to have a rather smug, superior attitude in general) a large part of that comes from the fact that they are keeping their wondrous matter conversion technology to themselves. So far, no super-inventor, no Dreamer omnigenius, not even the combined super-intellects of entire Better World Institute and IDEA think-tanks have been able to manage matter conversion at anything even vaguely approximating the scale or efficiency of Gilean technology. A large part of the scientific community believes it's not a Dreamtech invention at all, but some specific Dreamer power at work. I kinda want to make sure that's sunk in. This technology is so far beyond the capacity of modern science and super-science that there is a large number of people who believes it *exceeds the objective potential of Dreamtech*. Gil, of course, cannot confirm or deny this theory.

  The *other* big reason Gil isn't popular has to do with the war against Haptarus. And it's...well, complex. See, the thing is, on the one hand, Gil is more-or-less bankrolling the war against the Empire. They have offered an unlimited line of credit to the other Indelan nations to finance the war and their defense and various rebuilding costs and such. And, you know, that's great. But they've also made clear that it's not a gift, it's a loan. A loan that they are offering extremely flexible, virtually-no-interest repayment plans on. By all appearances, they really are trying to finance the war for the benefit of all. But...they do intend to recoup those funds eventually, and there are serious concerns that even if Haptarus is defeated, Gil will be in a position that it could take over Indelar by financial conquest. Even if there isn't some loophole to exploit in the contracts (one concern is that if the war gets bad enough, Gil might halt the flow of money unless more favorable terms are negotiated), Gil could end up holding enough leverage to be able to take over the lands now ruled by Haptarus. And if anything like this were to happen, the continent of Indelar being assimilated into the nation of Gil would be a huge shakeup on the world stage. Gil, of course, swears roundly they intend no such thing.

  On top of that, Gil hasn't actually contributed much to the fighting. They've officially declared war, and their own national defenses are extremely beefy (indeed, so much so that even Haptarus hasn't committed much towards engaging them directly), but they could be contributing a lot more to the effort in terms of materiel and particularly robotic soldiers. This only adds to the not-uncommon viewpoint that they are trying to profit from the war, and don't mind if it drags out.

  Maire is in many ways a nation of dreams and promise, though far from one where it is impossible for such things to go unrealized. The country was built on the principle that *anyone* could have the next Big Idea, come up with some creative, revolutionary solution to a problem, or some amazing piece of art that speaks to people in ways never experienced before. The country dedicates a substantial sum of its wealth to encouraging such creativity in its citizens. This had led to some great things \- the Mairen education system, while not quite on the same scale as say Dyburen's, is extremely well-funded and well-run. Their national universities are well-respected, their more artistic and creative course in particular generally considered world-class. The government also funds, subsidizes, and invests in a bewildering array of artistic and creative endeavors. Their cities reflect this, with beautiful architecture and cityscapes, as well as many famous museums, restaurants, and theaters that make the country a popular tourist destination (although admittedly, tourism has dropped off sharply since the war). The face of Maire is cities full of artists and thinkers, living idyllic, luxurious lives as they come up with their next great work.

  The reality, as it often is, is more complex. On the world stage, Maire takes a lot of flack for the treatment of its lower classes. Its many smaller, more rural communities get by well enough \- they aren't suffering by any means, but they don't get all that much in the way of federal funding and support, and see a disproportionate percentage of their taxes go to improving the cities or supporting big corporate interests. But they have it better than the underprivileged in the big cities. The cost of living in major Mairen cities regularly tops the global lists, and in fact, between housing costs and taxes, generally exceeds what people can make in most working-class jobs. Many working-class citizens in the cities not only need to work full time, but also get in a part-time job's worth of energy generation, just to have a little money leftover once their bills have been paid. The financial stresses of the war have made it even worse, and even the rural citizens are starting to feel the pinch. Nonetheless, Mairens have been slow to call for reform, because the promise of Maire gives everyone hope that one day they will have their Big Idea and become one of the elite who reap the rewards of the country's system.

  Though much of Maire extends into arctic regions, the country itself actually has a surprisingly temperate climate. There is a lot of geothermal activity near the surface, warming the land and resulting in hundreds of hot springs and even some open-air lava flows that attract about as much tourism as the cities. Naturally, this means that Maire generates a greater percentage of its energy geothermally than any other country (and in fact, efficient, environmentally-safe geothermal energy generation was pioneered in Maire, and is in many ways the Poster Idea for the Mairen dream).

  One thing Maire is *not* is a military powerhouse. They've managed to get a pretty *big* army (relative to their population) together by offering good salaries to soldiers and benefits to their families...buuuut that kinda backfired because now they have more soldiers than they can effectively train or properly equip. Their southern border is a good bit further north than it used to be. The armies of Haptarus seem to take a perverse pleasure in destroying, looting, and/or burning many of their museums and artwork whenever they take a city, sometimes even staging televised "auctions" where soldiers bid on priceless works of captured Mairen art and then destroy them in excessive fashion on live TV. So far plans for a superweapon to remotely trigger massive volcanic eruptions have been stalled by technical difficulties, but *don't think they're not still trying\!*

  And the Empire\! *Stops\!* ***HERE\!***  
  One of the most important things to know about Marketh is that about two-thirds of its northern border is shared with the original nation of Haptarus. And while Haptarus hasn't always been the Evil Empire it is now, conflict has never exactly been *uncommon* on the continent of Indelar, and Haptarus has always been one of the more aggressive states. Haptarus has been warring, on and off, with Marketh for literally centuries. Their blood feud makes the old rivalry between Ilessia and Limbra look like a slap-fight. They have been a priority target for the Empire from the very start of Haptarus' war of conquest.

  Through it all, they have endured.

  While Marketh doesn't have the strongest military force pound-for-pound in Indelar, what they do have is an extreme defensive focus. The capital of Marketh, located at its south-most point, is the largest and most heavily fortified city in the world, with just under a third of the country living there full-time. However, the city has the land and supplies \- including great swaths of farmland within the city itself \- to house the entire nation if that becomes necessary. Many other well-defended cities and towns dot the central portions of the country, all ready to withstand an attack and wage a brutal guerilla campaign against an invading army if it becomes necessary, to slow any progress towards the capital and allow their people the chance to retreat to it.

  And then, along the entire northern border, is the city known as the Wall. Itself a fortress occupied by nearly a sixth of the country's population and housing over seventy percent of its military. While Ilessia is widely regarded to have, pound for pound, the most advanced border defense emplacements in the world, what one has to remember is that Ilessia has way more border to protect than Marketh. And the northern border is where fully half of the country's border defense is concentrated. The Wall and the capital even both have border-defense style weaponry aimed upward atop high towers. Not covering the whole cities, but important buildings, to protect against rapid attacks from above. They developed it two years after Alpha Storm was first deployed. Despite decades of being hammered on by the Empire, including two direct assaults led by the Emperor himself, the Wall has never fallen.

  Haptarus has had slightly more success with internal attacks \- getting Dreamers or other forces with a high power concentration to slip around the wall, through a less defended part of the border, to wage attacks and sow chaos. These attacks come fairly regularly, But even they haven't been able to inflict much more than damage and annoyance. Part of the reason for this is that Marketh doesn't have mundane law enforcement. Their police force is staffed entirely by weapons-grade or stronger Dreamers and equivalent forces. They don't have as many as a modern city's police force, of course, but internal defense and law enforcement is basically handled entirely by the equivalent of superheroes \- and that's who these terrorist Dreamers have to deal with when they make their attacks.

  **Nydir:**

  **![][image28]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Curiosity  
  *Population:* 100 Million (0.4% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* F (Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 1/10  
  *International Reputation:* A-  
  *Chief Import:* Food  
  *Chief Export:* None (formerly Knowledge)  
  *Colors:* Purple and Blue  
  *Flag:* A grid of alternating purple and blue boxes with the other color as stars in the center of each one.

  Sometimes called the Cradle of Indelar, the oldest records of human settlers in the Indelan region come from Nydir, and it's believed to be the land where humans first set foot on the continent between expanding outward. As a result, many of the oldest families of Nydir have connections throughout the Indelan nations. Nydir has long been known for its friendly neutrality, both throughout Indelar and the rest of the world. They have often served as arbiters and mediators between other nations in times of conflict. Many an alliance, armistice, or peace treaty has been signed in Nydir's Hall of Elders.

  From its roots at the starting point of humankind's expansion on Indelar, Nydir has maintained a devotion to curiosity and exploration. Nydir strongly encourages its citizens to travel and learn, visit other countries and have new experiences. It also has a proud tradition of scientific discovery, although to a large degree the scientific focus of Nydir is less on inventing new things and more on answering questions. Many important scientific discoveries, such as a large swath of the elements and much of the great breakthroughs in physics and biology, come originally from Nydir. For a long time, Nydir's space program was one of the best in the world.

  Nydir itself has long been almost as frequent a destination for travellers as a source of them. Although its climate never really gets above temperate, it is known for its breathtaking cliffs and waterfalls alongside its outer coast, and for beautiful beaches around the calm waters of the Gulf of Nydir.

  Or, well, that's how Nydir *was*, anyway. It has been hit hard by the war against Haptarus \- its population decimated, its resources all but exhausted, and its military in tatters. Many fear it will be the next nation to fall. The only reason it is still holding on even tentatively is that a solid quarter of the fighting forces that Ilessia and Veneil have dedicated to the conflict are there holding Haptarus tentatively back. While Haptarus has yet to directly attack any non-Indelan nation and professes no desire to do so, everyone knows that that may change once Haptarus has a straight shot to the oceans, which conquering Nydir \- or, really, any of the remaining Free Nations, but with Nydir being the most likely \- would give it. And in fact, Nydir would be an *especially* strong strategic acquisition for that purpose, since the Gulf of Nydir offers an excellent staging point for building a naval fleet.

  **Pelal:**

  **![][image29]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Community  
  *Population:* 300 Million (1% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C+ (Nuke, Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 6/10  
  *International Reputation:* C+  
  *Chief Import:* Agriculture  
  *Chief Export:* Metal  
  *Colors:* Silver, Pink, and Orange.  
  *Flag:* Three pink circles overlapping like a Venn diagram, pale orange where two overlap and bright orange where all three overlap, against a silver background.

  You'd figure there'd have to be some story behind why the Indelan country closest to the continent to Peral has such a similar name, and to be fair, there probably was. But whatever it is has been lost to history. The similarities end with the name though; Pelal is an extremely modern, highly-industrialized nation. Their nation is rich in a variety of metals, not as much in iron as Endris, but many of their metals are important components in computers, electronics, and, interestingly, many forms of Dreamtech. They also have some extensive uranium mines.

  Pelal only has a few major cities, with most of its landscape covered by small to middling mining and factory towns. Most Pelalan communities are tightly-knit, with just about everyone knowing everyone else. It wouldn't be fair to call them *wary* of strangers and outsiders, quite \- they don't usually tend towards xenophobia or hostility \- but outsiders definitely receive their share of *attention*, and have often described a feeling of eyes ever being on them, and whispers always picking up when they leave a room.

  With that being said, the people of Pelal have been paying more of a mind since the war began to the ties of community not just between their towns, but also between the Free Nations of Indelar. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than in their stance to refugees, which they have welcomed with open arms. The Pelalan government has dedicated a substantial chunk of their powerful industrial complex to this end, and entire towns have sprung up in mere months to house all the refugees they've taken in. While new to the face of the countries, these "distant hometowns" as they've started to be called are quickly becoming an iconic part of Pelalan culture.

  Pelal's military is solid at the border, but stretched a bit thin within the country itself, a vulnerability Haptarus is happy to prey on. Air raids, small-scale blitz attacks, and Dreamer assault units regularly and randomly target Pelal's many small towns. Sometimes, they can be fought off. Other times, they leave nothing but ruin behind of the community that had once lived there. More and more, powerful Dreamers with the capability to fight are refusing to join the military proper, staying instead in their own towns so as to defend them in the event they are targeted by such an attack.

  **Shul:**

  **![][image30]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Heroism  
  *Population:* 100 Million (1% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* A- (Mechs, Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 7/10  
  *International Reputation:* C+  
  *Chief Import:* Weapons  
  *Chief Export:* Energy  
  *Colors:* Blue and Orange  
  *Flag:* A single big orange star in the center of a blue background.

  Shul considers itself the sword to Marketh's shield, the hammer to Marketh's anvil, the rock to Marketh's hard place. "Help those in need" is the country's motto, and they have not been shy about doing it. For that, they have earned a fair amount of respect, although it's been limited some by the fact that they tend to be kinda hot-headed and quick on the draw in general. "Do what you think is right first, figure out if you were correct later" is how a few of the recipients of their help have described them. Nonetheless, when a nation is in peril and calls for aid, especially in Indelar, Shul doesn't hesitate to answer.

  Pound for pound, Shul has the most powerful military in Indelar outside of Haptarus itself, and per-capita they have the largest investment in their military on the planet. They're unquestionably a powerhouseand would be a superpower if they had the raw resources for it. Shul has been fighting the war against Haptarus pretty much since it began, sending military Dreamers, power-armored special forces, and full-fledged mecha (which they are the only Free Nation to have developed, and in fact they have more mechs than any individual nation in the world, although they don't have as many full-scale ones as say Ilessia or Haptarus) to every country Haptarus threatened. It was only recently, with the fall of their southern neighbor Egardia, that the war came to Shul's border.

  It wouldn't be fair to say they were *happy* about it. Perhaps more accurately, it was something they had been *waiting for*. See, Shul's military contributions had been powerful and valuable, had definitely slowed down Haptarus' conquest, but the logistics had always kept them from really cutting loose. Now they can. For the past four years, the military of Shul has been hammering on Haptaran forces with unprecedented levels of success. They are the only Indelan nation to currently be *driving back* Haptarus at their border, with about 45% of the land that had formerly been Egardia having been liberated by Shul.

  While Shul's military prowess is definitely impressive and inspiring, the harsh reality is that it doesn't come without cost. They have lost a lot of people in this war, and it's a realistic concern that they won't be able to keep up this momentum forever, and the further they push into Haptarus the more territory they have to defend and the more exposed they are to a response. For now, the fact that Haptarus is spread thin is allowing them to continue pushing on, but if Haptarus were to bring the full might of its military down upon them before they can really fortify their newly-claimed territory, the results could be disastrous.

  **Telvir:**

  **![][image31]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Efficiency  
  *Population:* 250 Million (0.8% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* D- (Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 4/10  
  *International Reputation:* C-  
  *Chief Import:* Building Materials  
  *Chief Export:* Labor  
  *Colors:* Black and White  
  *Flag:* A black T in the center of a white background.

  Telvir has always been a difficult place to live. Most of its northern reaches are inhospitably cold and swampy lowlands, tough places to build a community and even dangerous to travel to, especially in late autumn and early spring where thick snow can cover the only partially-frozen mud and water, leaving the unwary hiker one wrong step from falling into clinging, icy muck. The more temperate southern regions are largely rocky, wind-swept hills and plains, poor for most forms of growing but not bad for raising livestock. The people of Telvir have long had to make do with just enough to get by \- and they've gotten very, very good at minimizing their consumption and maximizing the value of every resource as a result.

  Nowadays, life is somewhat easier thanks to modern advancements, but only somewhat. Telvir has limited solar and geothermal energy production, although they have extensive wind farms. Energy farms also have a unique characterization in Telvir. While throughout most of the world they're just a basic form of unskilled labor, not really stigmatized but still kinda low-status, in Telvir energy generation is almost as much a *sport* as a *job*. It's competitive, and many Telvirans spend a lot of effort and money training to maximize their numbers, upgrading their generation tools, and so on. Individual sleepers, individual Dreamers, teams, even towns, all compete with each other and can earn celebrity (as well as tax bonuses) for high numbers. And this whole setup is, itself, Telviran efficiency at its finest \- the competitive highs of emotion that this setup results in, like any emotion spikes, has a measurable impact on spiritual energy generation.

  Telvir also has extensive connections with other countries within and beyond Indelar (but especially with Peral) to provide efficient, competitive labor. Since a lot of other countries are comparatively luxurious, and Telvirans culturally pride themselves on their work ethic, it's often something of a win-win. The agreements generally stipulate that a small percentage of the taxes the Telvirans would normally pay to their host country goes to Telvir instead, allowing them to still bring in tax revenue while easing the resource cost necessary for the citizen's upkeep.

  Haptarus is pounding Telvir pretty hard. Their "get the most out of limited resources" style doesn't *really* hold up against Haptarus' "crush everything in your path with sheer overwhelming force" approach, and the relatively-open terrain of their southern reaches isn't optimal for the sort of guerilla approach that would have given them their best shot. Their border is being steadily forced northwards, and every acre of useful land lost hurts.

  **Terol:**

  **![][image32]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Precision  
  *Population:* 200 Million (0.7% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C- (Kill Sat, Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 4/10  
  *International Reputation:* C-  
  *Chief Import:* Metal  
  *Chief Export:* Machinery  
  *Colors:* Green, Orange, and Silver  
  *Flag:* An orange circle inside a silver square on a green background, vertically centered but positioned a bit off to the left of center.

  A major trade partner with Ilessia, Terol is well-known for its engineering works, and a fair portion of Ilessian machines and vehicles are manufactured there. Terol is a pleasant if somewhat plain country; it isn't known for its vistas, but the weather isn't bad and and scenery is certainly nice enough, just not anything spectacular. The cities and towns are well-designed and pleasing without really standing out. The people are polite and friendly enough. Quaint is probably the word most often used to describe it. Perfectly nice and pleasant without really standing out.

  It's a veneer that covers a wealth of secrets. Not dark secrets, necessarily. Just secrets.

  Terol is ruled by an organization called the Silent Council. How many members the Council has, and their identities, are closely-guarded secrets, even from each other for the most part \- each Councillor knows the identities of a few others only. When replacements are needed, the Council votes on one of the members to choose the replacement. Terol *also* has a President, who is democratically elected and serves as the go-between for the people and the Council. The President takes the people's concerns and desires to the Council for implementation, the Council dictates orders for the people to the President. However, since pretty much everything about the Council other than the brute fact of their existence is secret, the President has substantial leeway to interpret and in some cases even modify their orders. The Council and the people alike are able to impeach the President if they don't feel it is fulfilling its duties effectively.

  Terol's secretive approach to government also extends to a fair degree to their military. While Terol's raw fighting power is mediocre (their vehicles are marvels of precision engineering, but their armor and firepower, and especially their numbers, can't really compete with the likes of Ilessia or Haptarus), their military *intelligence* is top-notch. Terol is widely believed to have (they of course cannot confirm or deny this) the most extensive and effective spying network on the planet \- and the coverage of their fleet of spy satellites and stealth drones has kept more than a few foreign heads of state, allied or opposed, up at night. It's a pervasive but unproven belief among the populace that Terol is more-or-less blanketed in secret cameras, surveillance drones, and spy satellites. Mysterious disappearances...have been known to happen.

  Terol is having some trouble holding its border against Haptarus. Their strategy is solid \- they've got a couple *score* of kill sats basically guarding their border 24/7 (32/8, whatever) and frying anything that approaches. But Haptarus has made use of human wave tactics to minimize the effectiveness, and also damage Terol's international reputation. It doesn't look very good to other countries when you use your death satellites to fry what maybe looked like an invading army on camera but was actually a desperate wave of refugees.

  **West Luren:**

  **![][image33]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Loyalty  
  *Population:* 200 Million (0.6% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C (Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 1/10  
  *International Reputation:* D  
  *Chief Import:* Weapons  
  *Chief Export:* Biofuels  
  *Colors:* Green, Blue, and Black.  
  *Flag:* A black X separating a light green flag into four triangles, with a blue triangle (pointing inward) in the center of each one.

  West Luren lost the war of secession, and it's been pretty much downhill from there.

  As far as West Luren is concerned, they have worked tirelessly to keep the industries that have fueled their nation and offered work to their people for generations operating even in the face of internal revolt and international pressure intended to weaken their industry. As East Luren would tell it, they refused to adapt to changing times so that the wealthy CEOs of the big biofuel industries could stay on top of the pile. Where the truth lies is a matter for debate, but the historical fact is that they fell behind the rest of the world as renewable energies were developed, and now their biofuels are running out and they don't have a good enough replacement. It certainly doesn't help that for decades, most forms of modern energy were treated with severe cultural disdain, none moreso than the energy farming technology of modern Aranth.

  West Luren *is* starting to turn the energy game around by moving into geothermal energy, and they've had some success with it. But they're playing catch-up, and their current energy crisis is slowing the development of their geothermal plants. In the meantime, West Luren is one of the few nations of modern Aranth where outright systemic poverty still exists on a large scale (the biofuels were never anywhere close to enough to manage matter-generation). Many workers in West Luren perform long hours of backbreaking labor for barely subsistence-level pay, and the situation is presented as a national crisis that can only be solved by everyone working together and doing their part. Which, sure, it sounds like standard fare for the wealthy and powerful to maximize their wealth at the cost of everyone else. Except that honestly, West Luren doesn't really *have* "the wealthy and powerful" anymore. The energy crisis has gotten so serious, and internation finances so tied to energy production, that the only really wealthy people in West Luren are those with other resources for trade. And while sure, some of them hoard their wealth for their own benefit, *many* of them have poured vast sums into trying to improve their country.

  End of the day, the prevailing sentiment in West Luren is that their country has made some mistakes in the past, and it's up to them to turn it around. Despite their poverty they possess an incredible amount of national pride (not always a good thing \- they still almost completely reject spiritual energy collection technology; their sentiment can be basically summed up as "We are not a nation of hamsters\!") and fierce loyalty to their country and their fellow West Lureners.

  Weirdly, the war with Haptarus has in some way been a blessing. They've made strategic use of Gil's nigh-limitless credit line, pouring the money into energy resources that in the present can build up their defense and in the future turn their energy crisis around. This also allows them to fund a decent military, with pay that blows most working-class jobs in West Luren out of the water. It's definitely something of a financial risk, but it actually might be their best route to getting on their feet again as a country. And regardless, Gil is a lesser concern than their existing energy shortage, and by *far* a lesser concern than Haptarus.

  **Zell:**

  **![][image34]**

  *Cultural Watchword:* Self-Sufficiency  
  *Population:* 100 Million (1% Dreamer)  
  *Military Grade:* C+ (Special: Nulls)  
  *Wealth Rating:* 1/10  
  *International Reputation:* C  
  *Chief Import:* None  
  *Chief Export:* None  
  *Colors:* Yellow and Blue  
  *Flag:* A blue circle filled with a yellow star, against a yellow background.

  If Zell was the sort of nation that cared to interact with other nations on the world stage, it would probably be annoyed with Paradisia for stealing its schtick. But since Zell isn't that sort of nation, it responds to Paradisia stealing its schtick the way it responds to pretty much everything else other nations do: it doesn't care. Zell wasn't always like this, but after centuries in the conflict-heavy continent of Indelar, along with a few bad betrayals, the people of Zell finally decided they were done. They closed their borders, called back in their diplomats, refused access to outsiders, and basically told the world, "Leave us alone."

  Zell is a small but fertile country, nestled in a temperately warm area in mid-southern Indelar. Theirs is a land of rolling hills, light forests, fertile plains, and sandy beaches. They have everything they need to get by, although they are a fair bit behind the times in terms of scientific advancement, due to their limited communication with other nations. Dreamers are extremely important in Zell. They aren't Dreamer-exclusive like Paradisia, but the Awakening was, if not the cause, at least the catalyst for their cutting ties with the rest of the world. The Dreamers of Zell turn their powers to smoothing over the issues that their exclusionary foreign policy creates. While Dreamers don't necessarily hold any inherent special status over Sleepers in Zell, they can wield tremendous political power, as their powers may be key to certain important public functions.

  Zell has *tentatively* reopened contact with other nations as a result of the war in Indelar, contributing to the common war effort. Or, at least, coordinating with it. They have offered some assistance to other Indelan nations, but have so far refused offers of reciprocal aid for their own defense, even rejecting Gil's offers of credit and Shul's direct military support. They do not wish to be beholden to any other nation, and wish even less to be *dependent* on them.

  **Notable Organizations**

  **Ilessia's Dreamer-related Organizations**

  **The Assembly of Dreams:** The Assembly of Dreams (often simply called "the Assembly") is an organization devoted to integration of Dreamers into Sleeper society. It emphasizes public relations through the media, use of Dreamer powers to enhance local communities and business, providing a degree of organization through registration, training, and guidance services, and lobbying for laws to aid in Dreamer integration. The Assembly also maintains Hero Corps and the Assembly Cleanup Crew, two child organizations that focus on using Dreamer powers to directly assist local law enforcement and emergency services in times of crisis. The Assembly has numerous Dreamer members, but also many Sleepers on staff. It's a generally well-respected organization with excellent public relations, especially among Dreamers, though some ranking members use their sway with Dreamers to fulfill their own ends, and there are factions that believe the Assembly should focus on claiming more political power and control of government.

  At their best, the Assembly is an organization of heroes and good samaritans, using both supernatural and political power to better the lives of Dreamers and Sleepers alike. At their worst, they are massive civilian organization that counts many of the most individually powerful people on the planet among their number, and have no qualms about using that fact and their amazing media proficiency to change the world as they deem best.

* **Spoiler: Notable Factions**  
* Hide  
  **The Agency:** For a lot of people, the Agency is what they think of when they think of the Assembly of Dreams. While the Assembly also has large departments working in law, politics, and business, the Agency is the organization's media powerhouse. They are, by a vast margin, the single biggest provider of agents to Dreamer celebrities of all sorts. They negotiate on behalf of their clients for entertainment jobs, get endorsement deals, handle public relations and branding, and so on. They're the single biggest deparment in the Assembly, involving nearly 40% of its entire staff.

  **Hero Corps:** Hero Corps is a group of (primarily) Dreamers who actively take up the full-fledged superhero role. While they have no government ties, they are authorized to use their powers offensively in the protection of others, and have some (limited) law-enforcement authorization. They have a close relationship with SIDE; Hero Corps operates as a first response team, using teleportation technology or simple super-powered movement options to quickly respond to threats, bringing a lot of focused power to bear quickly. They also respond to lesser crimes, hazards, and general problems as they deem. Hero Corps is *very* popular, even on the international stage, although a lot of people in Ilessia actually associate them with SIDE rather than the Assembly (much to the Assembly's chagrin), since it usually goes as, "Hero Corps swoops in and saves the day, SIDE arrives a few minutes later and does the processing."

  The Corps is quite savvy as well. It is very well-known that intentional attack on the friends or family of a Hero to get at them will provoke an all-out assault by the *entire* Corps.

  Not all hero Dreamers are part of Hero Corps. It is possible to register as an "independent hero" without joining the Corps itself. Independents don't get all the perks of being in the Corps, and have somewhat tighter restrictions on their authority (and, notably, lack the Assembly's tremendous litigation shield) but also don't have to answer to them or deal with Assembly politics. Unregistered Dreamers who use their powers in this way are considered vigilantes, which is illegal. Officially, SIDE and the Corps are obligated to fight and arrest vigilante Dreamers. In practice, a vigilante who doesn't cause any serious harm or property damage and does good work usually gets a pass, although they'll be pressured to at least register, if not join the Corps outright.

  **The Circle of the Shared Dream:** A secretive group at the top levels of the Assembly. Not many people even know about them. They have a lot of influence throughout the Assembly, and from there, the country and even the world to some degree, and use their influence to sway the media, alter policy, and call upon Dreamers to handle specific tasks. They're secretive and manipulative, and while they aren't necessarily malevolent (they do seem to focus a lot of energy towards achieving net positive results), they can sometimes be coldly pragmatic and often take the long view of things. They are trying to mold the world into their idealized view of it, a project they call the Shared Dream, which...may or may not be a good or bad thing for any given individual or group. Possibly depending on the time of day.

  They are also very, very powerful. To even be considered for the Circle, one has to be a Dreamer with a Threat Level of at least 8, and that's rare \- the majority would qualify as Threat Level 9\. They also don't call themselves the Circle of the Shared Dream just because of their overall goal; they have some means of inducting their members into a supernatural link that allows them to share their powers among each other.

* **Spoiler: What Characters Might Know About The Circle of the Shared Dream**  
* Show

  **ACC:** Often referred to as "Hero Corps' kid sister", ACC is the Assembly Cleanup Crew. Made up primarily of Dreamers who want to help out but either can't or don't want to fight, they typically have powers like Healing, Nullify, Create, Transform, Enhanced Strength, Move Object, and so on. They are the ones who go in when the disaster is over. Once the Heroes have saved the day and SIDE has processed the scene, they work to heal the injured, repair damage, clear rubble, set up shelters, and just generally clean up. Basically, the super-powered Red Cross. They also do a lot of charitable work, and while they accept donations and put them to good use, they are well-funded by the Assembly. They don't have the sheer fame or popularity of Heroes or of Dreamers who sign on with the Agency, but they're generally deeply respected and welcome just about anywhere. Mess with a member of the ACC in front of a member of Hero Corps ***at your peril***.

  Being part of Hero Corps and ACC are not mutually exclusive, although an ACC Hero doesn't generally get afforded the raging protection from other Heroes unless they're actively on the job as ACC (Heroes back each other up when necessary, but they're also expected to be able to take care of themselves, and go into things knowing it's a dangerous job).

  **SIDE:** SIDE (Special Investigations and Dreamer Enforcement) is a military and law enforcement organization specializing in Dreamer-related crimes. They enforce laws governing Dreamers and serve as law enforcement regarding crimes committed by and against Dreamers. With a combination of expertly trained and experienced Unpowered and several Dreamers of various levels of power, even the most powerful Dreamers are slow to challenge SIDE. SIDE polices itself rigorously, but there remains a number of members, commanders, and even units that initiate black ops, as well as supplying training and equipment to smaller organizations with such aims.

  At their best, SIDE is the front line of defense for and against Dreamers, an elite organization that put their lives on the line to protect, and protect against, people with amazing special powers. At their worst, they are a secretive organization equipped with top of the line military technology and sufficient jurisdiction to use it against any Dreamer they deem even a potential threat.

* **Spoiler: Notable Factions**  
* Hide  
  **FIRE-SIDE:** The largest and most well-known division of SIDE is the Fieldwork, Investigation, Regulation, and Enforcement division, or FIRE-SIDE. They are the primary law-enforcement arm of the organization. They patrol, gather information, solve crimes, process scenes, arrest criminals, and when necessary, do battle personally to protect others from dangerous Dreamers (or to protect Dreamers from the dangers that their powers so often draw upon them). They are fairly well-respected, but many people, Dreamers in particular, regard them with some degree of caution.

  **OUT-SIDE:** OUT-SIDE is the Overseas Units and Training division of SIDE. That is, they're the military end of the organization. They don't do law enforcement; they are the ones who go to other countries in times of war, or assist allied governments in dealing with dangerous Dreamers. They are quite capable in personal combat, but as their name suggests, they specialize in providing training to other groups (allied armies, militias, resistance forces, etc).

  In the Ilessian military as a whole, these guys are considered the elite of the elite, the special forces that other special forces call when they can't get the job done. In SIDE as a whole...yeah, pretty much the same thing. They have the top toys and training of both SIDE and the Ilessian military, and have enough of a reputation that they can pick the top players from both with relative impunity.

  In terms of sheer reputation for martial superiority in Ilessian popular culture, there is no one \- not even Hero Corps \- that matches OUT-SIDE. Whether or not that reputation is fully merited is...certainly *open* to debate, but even if it's not strictly accurate, they are very, *very* close to as good as most of the country thinks they are.

  **IN-SIDE:** IN-SIDE is the Intelligence and Neutralization division of SIDE, and that's just as dark as it sounds. If FIRE-SIDE agents are equivalent to the FBI (with a heaping helping of SWAT thrown in), IN-SIDE is the CIA. And they're the Hollywood CIA to boot, the shadowy organization who are just as likely to be the bad guys of the film. They specialize in shadowy operations, ranging from as "nice" as deep-undercover investigations, to spying, black ops, and outright assassination.

  They're the ones who get their hands dirty \- and the *only* ones allowed to do so. IN-SIDE *also* serves as SIDE's Internal Affairs division. Between that and their reputation, even among SIDE, they're not well-liked or often much trusted. That said, they are *very* thorough in their investigations, and do not play games when exposing corruption in the rest of the organization. It's largely because of them that SIDE as a whole is so well-respected in general.

  **TOP-SIDE:** TOP-SIDE is the Tactics, Organization, and Protocols division. Or, as they are affectionately known to the rest of the organization, "the boring jobs". They are administration, management, bureaucracy, leadership, desk jobs, and so on.

  That said, don't underestimate them. Most of them are still combat-capable, and in their field, they wield a lot of power. SIDE as a whole wouldn't be the organization it is today if not for their constant efforts to improve procedures and strategies. Many TOP-SIDE agents are known for being Crazy Prepared often to the point of paranoia, and they have a reputation for coming up with ways to neutralize specific combinations of Dreamer powers with increasingly few resources for fun.

  **DES-SIDE:** DES-SIDE is the Detention, Evaluation, and Security division. They primarily handle the actual incarceration of Dreamers, and reintegrating them into society when their sentences have been served. They also monitor potential threats, such as Dreamers with substantial uncontrolled powers. On a broader scope, they are SIDE's security division, responsible for keeping their bases and information protected.

  **IDEA:** IDEA (Institute of Dreamer Education and Analysis) is a scientific organization that studies Dreamer powers, Dreamtech materials, and Dreamers themselves. Although most members of IDEA are knowledgeable and professional scientists, more maverick elements have given them something of a more negative reputation (kidnapping Dreamers to experiment on them, experiments gone wrong, etc). Nonetheless, IDEA has provided the world with a wealth of knowledge about Dreamer powers and numerous practical applications for Dreamer powers and Dreamtech alike. They also provide high-level technology for detecting, neutralizing, and combating Dreamers. IDEA's studies and experimentation run the gamut from helping Dreamers learn about their powers and capabilities, to augmenting and improving powers, to duplicating powers technologically, to seeking out effective ways to induce or remove powers. IDEA employs several Dreamers \- especially those with super-intelligence, super-inventing, and similar gifts \- but the majority of their staff are Non-Dreamers.

  At their best, IDEA is a font of knowledge and practical technology, providing the world with amazing advancement and helping people to understand and live with these powerful beings that walk among them. At their worst, they are classical mad scientists who see Dreamers more as an interesting and valuable experiment than living, breathing people.

* **Spoiler: Notable Factions**  
* Hide  
  **Scientific Departments:** IDEA is divided up into several scientific departments that focus on specific types of research.

* **Spoiler**  
* Hide  
  **Department of Analysis and Education:** The most public department (and overall the one with the best reputation), the Department of Analysis and Education focuses on the practical study of Dreamer powers, their usage, and their effects. They work closely with the Assembly and various educational institutions, helping Dreamers learn how to use and control their powers, and what their powers can *really* do.

  **Department of Biomechanics:** The Department of Biomechanics specializes in physiological and technological research and inventions. Cybernetic enhancement, genetic alteration, cloning, and similar sciences are their specialty.

  **Department of Dreamer Studies:** While the Department of Analysis and Education studies Dreamer *powers*, the Department of Dreamer Studies focuses on the *nature* of Dreamers and their abilities. How they work, why they manifest, how they can be duplicated or removed, and so on. They receive a *lot* of funding for their two biggest projects \- artificially inducing and removing Dreamer powers (naturally, their biggest contributors are Big Dreams, Inc. and the Reclaimers, respectively). While their success in those fields have been...limited (they've accomplished both, but with serious side-effects) they've managed several lesser breakthroughs in the understanding of Dreamer powers and expanding them into repeatable science (such as healing serums created using the blood or DNA of regeneration-capable Dreamers).

  **Department of Dreamtech Analysis:** The Department of Dreamtech Analysis focuses on studying existing Dreamtech, with the aim of developing new, mundane technology from it, or converting it to mundane technology. It's generally slow, often frustrating work (especially since it requires mundane scientists to work closely with super-scientists, which is just a pain for everyone), but has led to several valuable advances.

  **Department of Dreamtech Development:** While the DDA studies existing Dreamtech, the DDD creates new inventions. Often called "the playground" by the rest of IDEA, the DDD has the highest percentage of Dreamers on staff, being populated almost completely by super-scientists working together to devise wondrous new inventions. DDD facilities are *heavily* secured, but for those who are allowed in, they are a wonder to behold.

  **Department of Energy Management:** The Department of Energy Management works tirelessly to solve the primary challenge of modern Aranth \- energy. Energy availability is the primary limiter of the power of modern super-science, and the scientists here work tirelessly to develop new ways to generate energy, reduce waste, improve efficiency, and otherwise boost energy availability.

  **Department of Occult Sciences:** Looked down upon by the other departments, the Department of Occult Sciences is only barely considered a legitimate part of IDEA. When you live in a world where supernatural powers exist though, yeah, you can't really blame people for trying to study magic. The DOS primarily studies the mechanics of using Dreamer powers, how they tap into, use, and alter spiritual energy. Their hope is to eventually refine these powers into a trainable skill. On that, they haven't made any real progress, although they have devised ways to convert other forms of energy into something Dreamers can use, are responsible for a lot of breakthroughs in the understanding of Spiritual Energy, and are having some success enhancing (though not creating) items created through Dreamer Artificers. So, they've done good work, but they don't get much respect for it.

  **Department of Practical Sciences:** Interestingly, the Department of Practical Sciences is largely considered only a step above the Department of Occult Sciences by most of IDEA. To the rest of the world, though, they're probably the most respected (and certainly most valuable) department. They focus on mundane science entirely, incorporating Dreamer-based or super-science knowledge where useful, but focusing primarily on normal physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and so on. It's not that these sciences aren't appreciated by IDEA \- it's just that there are other scientific organizations that can do those jobs just as well, and a lot of IDEA scientists see such mundane work as beneath them.

  **The Dreamcatchers:** First thing to know about the Dreamcatchers (name assigned by the media), is that they are the Bogeymen of the Dreamer community. Supervillains, SIDE, even the Reclaimers have *nothing* on the Dreamcatchers in terms of inspiring utter dread in a tragically high percentage of Dreamers. There are highly-experienced, PL 10+, combat-capable, full-fledged members of Hero Corps who have *nightmares* about these guys.

  So who are they? They are secretive warrior-scientists who go out and *hunt* for Dreamers to experiment on. They are equipped with state-of-the-art technology (some that even SIDE can't get its hands on), and while they lack SIDE's numbers and aren't quite as well-trained (although a fair number do have a background in SIDE or the military), they even the playing field using high-tech stealth, surveillance, and power-neutralization technology. They study their target (sometimes for weeks or even months), and make blitz attacks when they are at their weakest, attacking for rapid neutralization and carrying them off to secret labs to study, tag, experiment on, and even dissect. You don't become a Dreamcatcher without being coldly dispassionate, and those that have been caught and jailed often admit that they don't see Dreamers as people at all.

  As a group, they can't hold a candle to SIDE or even Defiant Reclaimers in terms of total power, but they are patient, smart, amazingly-equipped, and Dreamers taken by them almost always end up severely traumatized...when they survive their experiences with their memories in-tact, that is. The fact that they are very careful about keeping their identities a secret and work as legitimate, respected scientists by day makes them that much harder to catch.

  IDEA as a whole officially denounces them and claims no association with them...but the simple fact is that the organization has made advancements with data that could only have come from Dreamcatcher experiments. It's the darkest stain on an organization that already has a bit of a reputation for taking things a bit too far in the name of science.

  **The Lights of Science:** The Lights of Science is an invitation-only society of those who are responsible for major advancements in modern science. The inventors of game-changing technology, developers of theories that push fields of study ahead, people who find amazing new uses for old knowledge, and so on.

  To be a member of the Lights of Science is incredibly prestigious, and its members are almost universally afforded incredible respect by both the scientific community and the world at large.

  Naturally, super-scientists hold the majority of seats. The Lights don't grade on a curve. That being said, those few mundane scientists who do join their number are only shown greater respect for proving able to compete among the greatest, often-superhumanly-enhanced minds in history.

  **Elderage College:** Elderage is *the* top Ivy League school in the country, possibly the world. One of the top three in the world for sure. It is IDEA-run and \-staffed, and even includes some of the Lights of Science among its professors. Even Non-Dreamer Elderage graduates have been known to work on Dreamtech right alongside super-scientists.

  **The Reclaimers:** The Reclaimers are an organization strongly opposed to Dreamers in general, seeing them and their powers as serious threats to themselves and to others. Officially, the Reclaimers lobby for strict regulations on the use of Dreamer powers, severe punishments for misuse, and segregation and regulation as necessary to ensure people are protected. Between accidental and deliberate misuses of Dreamer powers, and the damage caused thereby, they do have a fair case. However, their PR is utterly awful, owed largely to the fact that the organization also attracts a large number of Normals with grudges against Dreamers (people who were hurt, lost loved ones, or even were simply replaced by Dreamers), who have taken to violence and terrorism to "curtail the Dreamer threat". Adding to these people are several Dreamers whose powers ruined their lives (often those with highly destructive or uncontrollable powers), many of whom have entered into pacts to eradicate Dreamers and then suicide themselves. Worse, unscrupulous Dreamers who want to eliminate threats or competition often work with the Reclaimers or use them as patsies. Although these fanatics are a minority, they are a very visible one, giving the organization as a whole a bad reputation (and the Assembly, with their strong media connections and opposing ideology, only adds fuel to that fire). The Reclaimers are far less trained, organized, and equipped than SIDE, but many of them are fanatical to the point of obsession or insanity, the Dreamers of their number especially.

  At their best, the Reclaimers are the voice of reason in a world where the guy walking down the street could possibly have the power to disintegrate you to ash, blow up a city block, or turn you into a helpless slave with a thought. At their worst, they are a paramilitary terrorist organization who fanatically attack Dreamers, and tend to count the most unpredictable and destructive of those beings among their number.

* **Spoiler: Notable Factions**  
* Hide  
  **The Sentinel Project:** The Sentinel Project is a Reclaimers-staffed operation that...basically works like a Neighborhood Watch, except focused on Dreamers. They keep an eye out for suspicious use of Dreamer powers and report them to the authorities, and sometimes step in when immediate action is called for and no emergency personnel are on-scene. They...sometimes take things a bit far (and of course, any time they do, the Assembly makes sure it gets plenty of media attention), but for the most part their efforts are respected by the authorities.

  Sentinels generally have better PR than the norm for Reclaimers. Although they do focus on Dreamer crimes, they won't just sit back and do nothing when regular crime occurs (and they're competent enough that most mundane criminals don't want to tangle with them). A Sentinel presence in a neighborhood usually comes with a solid 20% or so reduction in crime compared to neighboring communities. A lot of people sleep better at night knowing Sentinels are on call.

  **The Repentent:** The Reclaimers *do* accept Dreamer members occasionally. They are often called the Repentent. Of course, typically, these are Dreamers who have a reason to hate their powers, which often means their powers are uncontrolled or otherwise dangerous.

  For the most part, the Reclaimers take on the Repentent to help them contain their powers. For some, they hold support groups and use therapy to help them resist the urge to use their abilities, treating the powers like an addiction. For those who simply can't control their powers, the Reclaimers offer containment, keeping their loved ones and the rest of the world safe from them. It's a kinda tragic service, but in many cases, a necessary one.

  Unfortunately, more radical elements in the Reclaimers often instead offer these troubled Dreamers an outlet to use their powers for "good" \- that is, in destroying other Dreamers. And there are some members of the organization who work to convince the Repentents that the only way to truly protect those they care for from their dangerous powers is through suicide. These sorts of stories are a big part of the reason that even the non-Defiant Reclaimers can't catch much of a break in the public eye (although, again, this isn't necessarily common and certainly isn't a majority).

  **The Defiant:** The Defiant are, sadly, what most people think of when they think of the Reclaimers. The Defiant are a minority \- but to be fair, not an insignificant one, with anywhere from 15%-25% of the organization estimated to be part of or at least supportive of the faction.

  The Defiant are terrorists and murderers, and there's little to mitigate that fact. They aren't nearly as competent or well-equipped as SIDE, or as patient and efficient as the Dreamcatchers, but they are utterly vicious and many of them are willing to accept collateral damage if it means bringing down "dangerous" Dreamers. While the Dreamcatchers are far more feared, few factions are as universally *despised* as the Defiants. Even their own parent organization publicly denounces them, although the Defiant are so thoroughly spread throughout the Reclaimers as a whole that it's far too easy for them to get access to funding and equipment through legitimate Reclaimer channels.

  The Protectors of Paradise and Defiant Reclaimers brutally attack each other pretty much on-sight, often with devastating results to any bystanders in the way. Hero Corps hates them almost as much \- they're one of the few groups who has ever gone so far as to attack the ACC in the middle of a disaster relief effort. Three times.

  **The Truthspeakers:** The Truthspeakers are your basic crazy conspiracy theorist. In The World According To The Truthspeakers, the entire government, most large corporations, the media, and more are all controlled by some huge Dreamer Conspiracy. They accuse IDEA of kidnapping normal people to turn into Dreamers (to be fair, I wouldn't put it past the Dreamcatchers to have tried it once or twice...), Hero Corps of being a Paradisian army, SIDE of just about everything they can think of whether contradictory or not...yeah, crazy conspiracy theorists, basically.

  I mean, they even say that there's some sort of, like, secretive cabal of powerful Dreamers at the head of the Assembly. And they're trying to, like, change the world man\! The whole world\! In some sort of shared project\! And they can use all of each other's powers, like a hive mind of high-level Dreamers or something\! I know\! Crazy right?

  Oh...wait...

  You see, here's the thing about the Truthspeakers. Yeah, a solid eighty, ninety percent of what they say is delusional, paranoid, *utter* nonsense. But the rest is some of the most carefully hidden, heavily guarded, viciously protected secret information in the setting. When you *need to know what's really going on*, they are, hands down, the best people to look to. If, and only if, you can manage to separate the delusions, misunderstandings, and outright lies from the critical secret information.

  Unfortunately, no one actually *knows* that, so all the secret stuff gets treated like more of their delusional ramblings.

  **Big Dreams Inc.:** Big Dreams, Inc. is a huge corporation with fingers in a whole lot of financial pies. They specialize in Powers for Profit, using Dreamer powers to make big money. They operate in similar circles to the Assembly, but focus less on the more societal aspects of things, and more on business and business-related interests. For example, while they don't have the sort of massive media presence or legal lobbies as the Assembly, their marketing, advertising, and legal resources are at least as robust. The vast majority of Big Dreams employees are Dreamers \- for the most part, Mundanes are only involved as independent contractors for basic labor, and even that's kinda rare. There are a few Mundanes who have earned their way into the company by virtue of having sufficient sheer skill to compete with Dreamers in their fields, but it's a fraction of a percentage of the company.

  The founding principles of Big Dreams are helping Dreamers use their powers to earn the sort of income and build the sort of life they deserve. While they don't place any great inherent value on Dreamers themselves, they say it's a simple fact that Dreamers have *more to offer* society than an equivalent Mundane, and should both be using their powers where they can provide the most benefit to society, and be earning a profit commensurate with the extremely valuable services they can provide. As an organization, they have a reputation for caring about two things and two things only: Wealth and Power. This isn't strictly accurate, but it's not unfair to say that these are, if not the primary motivations of many of those in the company (especially at the higher levels), at least important steps to achieving those motivations. That being said, one of the company's mottos is "A Mutually Beneficial Arrangement". They have a firm understanding that long-term gains come from long-lasting relationships, and actively cultivate strong business partnerships, positive brand recognition, and loyal customer bases. They aren't opposed to achieving these things through marketing and advertising, but if they can do it through providing a superior product, service, or offer, that's all the better, and generally preferable.

  Big Dreams has countless subsidiary businesses working in all areas of commerce. Their core function is to provide services for Dreamers in the business world. This ranges from helping Dreamers find jobs that suit their powers (sometimes in their own subsidiary companies, sometimes among other employers for a finder's fee), training Dreamers in the use of their powers in the business world and in various business skills, investing in Dreamer entrepreneurs, offering networking opportunities, and providing their own services to various businesses. Between their subsidiary companies, investments, and various fees and services, they bring in a lot of money. And between the powerful Dreamers on their Board of Directors, and the vast number of Dreamers in their various businesses or with connections to them, they have ready access to a tremendous amount of personal power.

  It's a standard belief in the company that Dreamer powers are *valuable*, and failing to fully capitalize on that value is wasteful and stupid. Thus, they tend to look down on any sort of people or group who get Dreamers involved in such wasteful things as fighting. They see Hero Corps and various Independent heroes and vigilantes as just a heaping mass of wasted potential, and the Defiant, Dreamcatchers, Dreamer criminals, and similar people not only as criminals for what they do, but for perpetuating a culture where Dreamers feel like it's right and even *good* to use their powers to fight others. That said, let there be no doubt that Big Dreams absolutely has pieces in the public and private security games, and definitely has its share of members that cross legal and moral lines in the name of Wealth and Power.

  At their best, Big Dreams, Inc. is a company that helps Dreamers take full advantage of their powers in the real world, and helps ensure that people are putting their powers to good and productive uses that everyone, Dreamers and Mundanes alike, can reap the benefits of. At their worst, they are the epitome of the heartless megacorp that will do almost anything in the name of Wealth and Power.

* **Spoiler: Notable Factions**  
* Hide  
  **The Big Dreams Network:** The Big Dreams Network is in many ways the core of Big Dreams, Inc. It is a firm that primarily works to assist Dreamers in profitizing their powers \- in exchange, of course, for a healthy commission. The Network primarily offers legal, financial, marketing, and training services \- advisors, seminars, classes, and so on for Dreamers seeking to make a profit with their powers. Beyond that, though, the Network is, well, just that, a country-wide network of Dreamer professionals. The Network facilitates communications between Dreamers who might be able to assist each other's business goals, as well as seeking out Dreamers who could improve the marketability of their powers. The Network is also active in high schools and colleges, helping jump-start Dreamer students' entry into the work force as well as offering loans, scholarships, and (very often paid) internships for promising students. Many colleges have a sorority and fraternity tied into the Network, allowing Dreamers an exclusive place to meet, build relationships, and interact with other successful Dreamers. Finally, the Network is the single largest source of investments for Dreamer startups in the country. While the Network does offer paid services, they prefer to work on a commission basis, receiving a percentage of additional earnings over a set period of time rather than a flat fee. They feel this is both better for their clients and brings in a higher profit in the long term.

  **DreamCorp:** DreamCorp is the largest subsidiary company of Big Dreams. "DreamCorp Sells Every Thing" is the company's slogan, and it is not far from the truth. Pretty much any material good available on the open market \- and quite a few that aren't \- can be found in one of DreamCorp's enormous stores or on its website, at competitive prices. DreamCorp handles the entire process in-house \- production, marketing, transport, sales \- and its employees are 100% Dreamer. Any tasks not done by Dreamers are done by robots or other automated machinery. With a small workforce, no need for middlemen, and the incredible efficiency of purely Dreamer employment, DreamCorp can offer a bewildering array of products at a low cost, and pass the savings right on to its...uh, shareholders, mostly. But enough to its customers to beat most lesser retail outlets. While DreamCorp employees do receive extremely comfortable salaries, the lion's share of their income comes from stock in the company.

  It's worth noting that for those who know where to go and what to ask, DreamCorp is also a substantial resource for illicit and black market products.

  **The Dream Jobs Center:** While the Network helps prepare Dreamers for the workforce, the DJC is all about finding Dreamers the jobs that their powers are optimized for (and collecting the resultant finder's fees). The DJC primarily works at matching Dreamers to jobs and jobs to Dreamers, but they also work to secure the positions and negotiate on behalf of their Dreamer clients. A big part of the DJC is ensuring that the Dreamers receive the compensation they *deserve* for their jobs. The DJC focuses primarily on long-term employment, but they do have subsidiaries \- DJC Temp and DJC Gigs \- for finding temporary or one-off jobs, both of which are extremely popular as they are very good at negotiating a high price for useful powers, allowing Dreamers to do some quick work, cash a big check, and then go about doing what they like until they need money again.

  **Dream Team Securities:** The Big Dreams security firm, offering Dreamer-caliber protection for a price. Very importantly, none of their bodyguards, troubleshooters, mercenaries, and so on are actually Dreamers. They provide combat-robots designed by master super-inventors, mercenaries bolstered by Dreamer augmentations and equipped with cutting-edge Dreamtech weaponry or powered armor, technopathically fortified automated defense and security systems, battle-ready summoned guardians, and so on. In short, they put Dreamer powers to protective work while keeping their incredibly valuable Dreamers *as far the flip from harm's way as humanly possible\!* They are founded on one of the core principles of Big Dreams, Inc: that putting resources as valuable as powerful Dreamers into situations where they could *actually die* is the most monumentally stupid decision that one could possibly make in the modern age.

  **Organization Relations**

  **The Assembly and SIDE:** The Assembly views SIDE...more-or-less positively. They do believe that SIDE is an absolutely necessary organization, and largely respect them for the work they do. They try to keep things positive and professional whenever they interact. The Assembly is somewhat leery of SIDE's more shadowy operations, and generally would prefer more transparency in the organization. They also do tend to draw a hard line when SIDE comes around looking for information on Dreamers, typically challenging such actions legally by default. Not so much because they want to interfere with SIDE as because they have a reputation for protecting Dreamers' confidentiality and work hard to keep it.

  While SIDE would prefer somewhat more cooperation on the legal end, and do tend to feel that the Assembly's pro-Dreamer lobbying benefits their politics at the expense of what is strictly practical for the country and its laws, they reciprocate the Assembly's largely positive relationship. They do generally see the Assembly as a useful place to guide problem Dreamers to before their powers land them in serious trouble. That said, SIDE is somewhat leery of the power the Assembly wields, and IN-SIDE in particular considers keeping tabs on them a priority.

  Hero Corps, in particular, has a close relationship with SIDE. While it can be strained in some places, in most cities SIDE deeply respects Hero Corps and is happy to have their assistance in difficult or dangerous cases. It usually isn't hard for Heroes to get SIDE to keep them in the loop on investigations related to situations they've handled, or even to allow them to assist in investigations directly. A rivalry between the two isn't uncommon, but it's usually friendly.

  **The Assembly and IDEA:** The Assembly is admittedly a bit leery of what they consider some of the "fringe elements" of IDEA (and of course, they are steadfast opponents of the Dreamcatchers and any like them). But for the most part, the Assembly has a strong relationship with IDEA, and IDEA is pretty much totally chill with them. They see each other as two sides of the same coin in many ways \- IDEA helping Dreamers learn about their powers and capabilities, while the Assembly helps them fit into society in their new circumstances. That being said, the Assembly doesn't offer IDEA much help in terms of PR spin when their experiments go wrong \- they see it as the act of a friend trying to help their friend learn its lessons when it messes up.

  **The Assembly and the Reclaimers:** It should come as no surprise that there is no love lost between the Assembly and the Reclaimers. The two organizations are ideologically opposed. The Assembly *gleefully* throws fuel on the fire of whatever PR disasters the Reclaimers regularly find themselves in, and denounce them unilaterally as hateful and, frankly, stupid bigots. While they are well known for their media conflicts and the occasional battles between Hero Corps and the Defiants (which are usually curb stomps in Hero Corps' favor), the real war between the Assembly and the Reclaimers is in the political arena, where the Assembly lobbies hard for more Dreamer-favorable laws, and the Reclaimers for laws that put more restrictions and regulations on what Dreamers can do. In this, they actually do serve as an important check on each other, although more moderate members of both often say that if they didn't have to oppose the nonsense being lobbied for by the other side, the more extreme elements of their own side's political agendas wouldn't be necessary.

  **The Assembly and Big Dreams:** The Assembly tends to feel that Big Dreams cares a bit too much for cold profit, rather than societal benefit, and that they are probably *too* Dreamer-exclusive. Sleepers matter too, after all\! Big Dreams has their own objections to the Assembly's way of doing things. They feel the Assembly doesn't do nearly enough to get Dreamers what they *deserve* in repayment for what they offer to society. In particular, they see the sheer number of Dreamers wasting their talents in entertainment as senseless, feel that the ACC are getting completely robbed (healers *especially* \- Big Dreams healers make millions curing terminal ailments for wealthy patrons), and believe Hero Corps to be the single stupidest thing any organization could possibly encourage its Dreamers to do.

  That all said, while there is *definitely* a deep ideological divide between the two organizations, they do recognize and respect the good work the other does in their areas, and when called upon to work together (often for the benefit of some particular Dreamer(s)) they can do so with professional courtesy. While there is some overlap in their efforts (the Assembly has its toe in the water in business and finding jobs for Dreamers, and Big Dreams does help Dreamers break into the entertainment industry *when* their powers are particularly suited for it) they don't really compete heavily in each other's fields, so there isn't really any serious conflict between them, just a vocal disagreement.

  It's probably a good thing that the relationship between these two groups is notably cool. An alliance between the Assembly and Big Dreams would concentrate an enormous amount of personal, financial, political, and social power all in one place. That's a nightmare scenario for the Reclaimers in particular, but even more neutral and pro-Dreamer people and groups are kinda concerned about what Ilessia would look like in the event of such an alliance.

  Which does make it kinda terrifying that there are at least four members of the Circle of Shared Dreams sitting on Big Dreams' Board of Directors...

  **SIDE and IDEA:** SIDE and IDEA have a very close working relationship. A sizeable chunk of SIDE's funding goes to IDEA, and in return they get the information and technology they need to do their jobs. There is absolutely no question that SIDE wouldn't be anything near the organization that it is without IDEA's research and technology backing them up. Likewise, SIDE has always been one of the biggest sources of IDEA financing, and the organization wouldn't be able to do a fraction of the work it has without them.

  Unfortunately, the darker corners of the two organizations share equally close ties. Corrupt, rogue, or simply unprincipled SIDE agents are often the first line of defense for unscrupulous IDEA scientists, and though they're loathe to admit it, rogue elements of SIDE are in many ways just as responsible for the Dreamcatchers as IDEA.

  **SIDE and the Reclaimers:** SIDE's relationship with the Reclaimers is kinda all over the map, but at the end of the day leans positive. The Reclaimers benefit SIDE in a number of ways, not the least being that their politics are usually pushing laws that, whether you agree with them or not, end up favorable to SIDE agents doing their jobs. SIDE is a common source for training and equipment for Sentinels, and of course, Reclaimers are a good source of simple manpower \- joining a law enforcement, military, or intelligence organization that focuses on dealing with Dreamers is a fairly natural progression for people with a Reclaimer upbringing. Unfortunately, some of these people can take it too far, not only abusing their authority on the job, but also slipping SIDE information and resources to Defiants.

  It's not all smiles and handshakes though. SIDE conflicts regularly with the Defiant, and while the Reclaimers respect the job SIDE does, they have a lot of criticism for *how* they do it. SIDE is a frequent target of Truthspeaker conspiracies. So it's not a relationship without tension.

  **SIDE and Big Dreams:** SIDE and Big Dreams have a strictly professional relationship. Clinically so. Sure, Big Dreams offers some resources that SIDE purchases, and when crimes befall their employees they dutifully call SIDE, but neither offers the other any particular special treatment. And sure, Big Dreams denounces SIDE's practice of putting Dreamers into combat and SIDE is sometimes called upon to investigate them for white collar crimes, but it's not like they're hostile or anything. They do their jobs and when they overlap, they deal with each other and move on.

  Or, at least, that's how the relationship goes in the broad strokes, between the two organizations. Now, on a more individual level...well, let's just say that there's a whole chapter in the Unwritten Big Dreams Playbook about how a SIDE agent is one of the best investments a new Dreamer businessperson can make, and leave it at that.

  **IDEA and the Reclaimers:** IDEA's generally fine with the Reclaimers. Oh, sure, their more radical elements are clearly crazy, but it's not like IDEA hasn't had its share of crazies besmirching its good name. In the general sense, they tend to see mainstream Reclaimers as a healthy check on Dreamer power in society. IDEA knows as well as any just how harmful Dreamer powers can be if not properly controlled or monitored. For their part, the Reclaimers have a lot of respect for IDEA. They do wish they'd focus more on defense against Dreamer powers and less on augmenting or (especially) inducing them, but IDEA is responsible for information and technology that allows people to detect, counteract, and even match the powers of Dreamers. To the Reclaimers, that's big. Every time IDEA manages to take something that used to be achievable only through Dreamtech and accomplishes it with reproducible technology, the Reclaimers count it as a big win for Normal people everywhere. The Reclaimers provide a substantial amount of funding for IDEA research centered around such work, as well as better ways to detect and counter powers, and, their biggest goal \- ways to permanently remove powers altogether.

  Also, just so we're clear, there are Defiant groups who downright *worship* Dreamcatchers. When a Dreamcatcher needs some disposable patsies, the Defiant are their go-to choice.

  **IDEA and Big Dreams:** Big Dreams and IDEA actually have a fairly negative relationship, largely because Big Dreams wants to *be* (or, at least, run) IDEA. Big Dreams has dozens of tech and science companies throughout Ilessia, but none of them have achieved the sort of breakthrough successes that IDEA has. The Institute has also proven remarkably resistant to buyout attempts \- while they happily accept funding for certain projects, at the end of the day, they're in it for the science. Big Dreams has lured a fair few Dreamer scientists away from the Institute, but for all their wealth and power, they just haven't been able to build a company that really rivals the just-slightly-crazy zeal of IDEA's eclectic bunch of aggressively curious scientists.

  **The Reclaimers and Big Dreams:** It should come as no surprise that these two organizations are outright hostile to each other. Let's not even talk about the Defiant \- the Reclaimers have actually managed to do something Big Dreams considers dumber than Hero Corps by getting Dreamers to join them and then convincing them to *not use* their powers or even, in the most extreme cases, *kill themselves*. Which is of course a minor matter compared to the much more egregious fact that Reclaimer politics are simply bad for business.

  On the Reclaimer side, the fact that Big Dreams is essentially Dreamer-exclusive is bad enough, but the real sticking point is how Big Dreams actively seeks to put Dreamers into place in more and more companies, wiping out dozens, hundreds, even thousands of jobs for Normal workers who just can't compete with super-powered employees. As much press as big things like Defiant attacks and political wars with the Assembly get, this is one of the biggest concerns for the vast majority of day-to-day Reclaimers in the country \- skilled professionals being relegated to energy generation because they got laid off from their jobs after a single Dreamer replaced an entire workforce. Reclaimers naturally have a standing boycott on Big Dreams businesses, especially DreamCorp. And Big Dreams happily responds to that with well-concealed subsidiary companies designed to market their goods to Reclaimer-leaning people at a modest markup. Rumors that this markup is noted in their books as an "idiot tax" are probably just one more paranoid Truthspeaker conspir- no wait that's actually true, isn't it?

  **Organization-related Benefits**

  **Assembly Agent:** You are a member of the Agency. Your media connections allow you to get access to people and events centered around Dreamer entertainment more easily than most, and you get a \+2 bonus on Deception and Persuasion checks when interacting with the media or entertainment producers. If you also have the Connected Advantage, this bonus also applies to checks to secure favors from Dreamer celebrities that you represent.

  Members of the Agency also typically have at least one rank of Wealth, with two being the average.

  **Hero:** You are a full-fledged member of Hero Corps. When operating in a heroic capacity, you can expect the Assembly to spin your actions in the best possible light, and to cover minor-to-moderate legal or financial issues (such as collateral damage) that might come up. You can also expect most people to be generally aware of who you are, which usually results in a favorable response from civilians, and a healthy respect from villains and criminals. Most enemies will know better than to try to go after your loved ones to get at you.

  The Hero Corps salary is enough to justify Wealth 1 if it's not put to other use.

  **ACC:** You are a member of the Assembly Cleanup Crew. You can expect to be shown respect and welcome from all but the most hateful of individuals (or those who have personal reason to dislike you), and you have the Assembly's backing with respect to charitable or humanitarian works you wish to undertake. If you come under attack while acting in your official capacity, you can expect any Heroes who might come to defend you to give their all \- you may spend your Hero Points and Luck Rerolls on their behalf.

  The Assembly Cleanup Crew salary is enough to justify Wealth 1 if it's not put to other use.

  **Circle of the Shared Dream:** You have managed to secure a position in the enigmatic Circle of the Shared Dream. This Benefit extends the scope of other Benefits that afford social and political influence, if you possess them, as the GM deems appropriate for being a member of this powerful secret society. Affected benefits include, but are not limited to, Wealth, Fame, Security Clearance, and Diplomatic Immunity. The Circle is made up exclusively of Dreamers with a personal Threat Level of 8 or higher, and members generally possess at a minimum Wealth 4 and Cipher 4 in addition to this Benefit, and they must also possess the Shared Dream powers. Naturally, GM discretion is strongly advised before allowing a PC to take this option.

* **Spoiler: Shared Dream**  
* Hide  
  **Shared Dream:** Immunity 2 (Hostile powers from other members of the Circle), Senses 1 (Communication Link \[Other members of the Circle\]), Feature 1 (Choose an array; power stunts off of that array can be used to duplicate powers of other members of the Circle, and they can power stunt off of their chosen array to duplicate powers of your array), Feature 1 (Shared Dream powers cannot be detected by power scans and the like) {5}.

  **FIRE-SIDE Agent:** You are an agent of FIRE-SIDE, which gives you full law enforcement authority with regards to Dreamers and Dreamer-related crimes, as well as basic SIDE security clearance. You receive a \+2 bonus on Insight checks against Dreamers.

  **IN-SIDE Operative:** You are an operative of IN-SIDE, immune from prosecution for most crimes committed as part of an authorized IN-SIDE operation, and able to access basic confidential SIDE information. You receive a \+2 bonus on Deception checks against Dreamers.

  **OUT-SIDE Soldier:** You are a soldier of OUT-SIDE, which gives you basic military clearance, access, and authority, not to mention a reputation for being part of one of the most elite forces in the Ilessian military. You receive a \+2 bonus on Intimidation checks against Dreamers.

  **TOP-SIDE Analyst:** You are an analyst in TOP-SIDE, which gives you access to high-level SIDE clearances and protocols. If you can come up with a credible way to use your equipment or environment to potentially counteract a Dreamer's powers, you may take the Counter action using your Expertise (Tactics, SIDE Agent, or Dreamer Lore) rank minus 5 as the rank of the Counter.

  **DES-SIDE Specialist:** You are a security specialist in DES-SIDE, which gives you relatively easy and rapid access to SIDE prisons and security systems, as well as basic SIDE security clearance. You receive a \+2 bonus on Technology checks to design or defeat security.

  **DAE Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Analysis and Education, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. Your experience with helping Dreamers understand the limits of their powers allows you to suggest possible power stunts to allied Dreamers \- when doing so, you may spend a Hero Point to negate their fatigue from the stunt, as you come up with an efficient means of using their power to achieve the desired result.

  **DBM Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Biomechanics, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. When using the Inventor Advantage to create biological or cybernetic inventions that have purely personal physical effects (they can't just be fluff for an energy, sensory, mental, or otherwise non-physical power) you can design the invention concurrently with building it, rather than having to spend time on each one separately, though you must still make a separate check for each.

  **DDS Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Dreamer Studies, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. You have experience converting Dreamer powers into technology. When using the Inventor Advantage to create inventions based off the power of another Dreamer, if that Dreamer is present for the process, it can perform a Team Check for your check using its power rank.

  **DDA Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Dreamtech Analysis, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. You have experience analyzing Dreamtech; by studying a piece of Dreamtech as a move action, you can make a Technology check, DC 20 \+ one-fifth its PP value (before counting the Removable or Easily Removable flaws). If you succeed, you learn its basic function. With a two-degree success, you learn its full powers.

  **DDD Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Dreamtech Design, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. Your proficiency with constructing Dreamtech gives you a \+2 bonus on Technology checks to use the Inventor Advantage.

  **DEM Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Energy Management, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. Most modern businesses, even those that have some things to hide, compete vigorously for energy efficiency consultations by skilled DEM scientists. As long as there's no specific, personal reason not to, you can use your credentials to talk your way into most businesses, and while they won't necessarily give you your run of the place, they'll show you around and let you in to certain relevant areas. If that isn't enough, getting into more heavily secured locations is for you to figure out.

  **DOS Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Occult Studies, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. You can use your Technology or Expertise (Science) skills to Aid other characters using the Artificer or Ritualist advantages. You may also spend a Hero Point to negate the fatigue from an ally's power stunt off of a power with the \[Magic\] source by helping them work out how to cast the spell they're attempting more effectively.

  **DPS Scientist:** You work in IDEA's Department of Practical Sciences, giving you certain scientific certifications and credentials. Other IDEA scientists may see your work as almost trivially routine, but sometimes it's the routine stuff that's most important. When making Technology or Expertise (Science) checks as Routine checks, you treat your result as if you had rolled a 12 rather than a 10\.

  **Dreamcatcher:** You have turned your skills to the dark work of the Dreamcatchers. You are a master of unobtrusive surveillance; unless you interact with someone specifically, do something that draws particular attention, or are recognized personally, bystanders won't really notice or pay attention to you, meaning that general Investigation checks to canvas for information won't turn up your presence.

  **Elderage Graduate:** You are a graduate of the prestigious Elderage College. You can be assumed to have a variety of contacts \- former classmates, professors, etc \- working in various high-level scientific fields. In addition to such networking resources, if you can't answer a question off the top of your head, you probably know someone who can. Given a minute or so and access to a means of communication, you may attempt to learn the answer to a question for an Expertise skill you aren't trained in. You use your highest Expertise skill to make the check, which cannot be Routined.

  **Light of Science:** You are a member of the prestigious Lights of Science. You can expect great respect and reasonable assistance throughout the scientific community. You may substitute your highest Expertise or Technology skill for Persuasion when attempting to make a positive impression or request assistance or favors from members of the scientific community. You may also substitute any Expertise skill for Deception when trying to convince someone of something relevant to the field, or to recognize whether someone is trying to deceive you relative to such matters.

  **Authorized Sentinel:** You are a member of the Sentinels, giving you limited authority to detain criminals, carry weapons, and use force in defense of others. You get a \+2 bonus on Persuasion towards Reclaimers and law-enforcement personnel, and a \+2 bonus on Intimidation against Dreamers.

  **Repentant Dreamer:** You are a member of the Repentent, taught how to control your powers...and, perhaps, how to make use of them to overcome those of other Dreamers. This Benefit gives you access to a special combat maneuver, similar to All Out Attack, Power Attack, and so on, called Repentance. While using Repentance, you take a penalty from \-1 to \-5 on all of your Dreamer power ranks, in return for an equal bonus on all resistance checks against Dreamer powers. You must have a Dreamer power with at least as many ranks as your penalty, you can't more than double any resistance bonus, and you must have at least five PP worth of Dreamer powers per point of the modifier you wish to use (so at least 25 points if you want to be able to take the full \+/-5).

  **Defiant Fanatic:** You are a fanatical Defiant, willing to die for your cause. You halve the effective rank of nonlethal Damage. However, your opponents may freely choose to inflict lethal Damage upon you, assuming they're willing to kill you (lethal damage renders you Dying when you would normally be Incapacitated, and kills you outright if you fail your resistance check by five or more degrees). Obviously, PCs should think carefully before taking this Benefit, but it's great for nameless Defiant Minions\!

  **Speaker of Truth:** You are a ~~crazy conspiracy theorist~~ Truthspeaker\! Any time you attempt to gain information using Inspiration or the Well Informed advantage, you may request the GM give you some Truth along with it. The GM then provides some manner of obscure hint that could reveal some secret detail critical to the plot or setting, of its choice (you don't get to specify the subject). However, the GM can bury this hint among any number of equally tantalizing, but misleading, false, or outright crazy additional pieces of "information". You may reject Truth that directly conflicts with your character's core concept or beliefs, but that aside, your character is expected to act as if any Truth learned is, well, true. All claims and evidence to the contrary are clearly false information being perpetuated by the Dreamer Conspiracy\!

  **Networker:** You have joined the Big Dreams Network, giving you access to connections with a wide variety of entrepreneurial Dreamers. At the cost of a Hero Point representing a future off-screen favor, you can get a Dreamer to provide a power for a safe, non-combat, legal (unless you spend a second Hero Point) purpose. You may specify broadly what the power should do, but the GM builds it, and it has a point value equal to half your Persuasion skill, multiplied by your ranks in the Wealth benefit minus 1 (so if you have Persuasion 12 and Wealth 4, the power can be worth up to 18 points). It may take some time to contact the Dreamer and get them to where you need them, though, so this can't usually be done in fast-paced situations.

  Most members of the Big Dreams Network have at least two ranks of Wealth, with three being the most common. There's only slightly fewer members with Wealth 4 than 2, and Wealth 5 is far from impossible.

  **DreamCorp Employee:** You are an employee of DreamCorp, and DreamCorp Sells Every Thing. You can always provide a lead on where to find even the most obscure of items, provided they exist. You get a \+2 bonus on any interaction skill checks necessary to acquire the items.

  Even junior DreamCorp employees can justify Wealth 1 on their salary. Higher Wealth ranks can be assumed to directly translate to higher levels of authority in the corporation.

  **Dream Job:** You work at the Dream Job Agency, which means you have access to files on all sorts of Dreamers looking to make a profit with their powers. Once per adventure, you can Edit Scene without spending a Hero Point to declare the existence of a Dreamer with a specific powerset (although the GM decides its actual stats). You get a \+2 bonus on any interaction skill checks necessary to convince them to assist you, although Dreamers brought into play by this Benefit will never provide combat or otherwise dangerous assistance, and there's a \-5 circumstance penalty on any checks to convince them to assist in an illegal activity (though your \+2 still applies to offset this somewhat).

  Even junior Dream Job agents can justify Wealth 1 on their salary. Higher Wealth ranks can be assumed to directly translate to higher levels of authority in the agency.

  **Dream Team Equipped:** Your combat equipment and devices are provided by Dream Team industries. If lost beyond repair or recovery, it can always be replaced between adventures, assuming you have means of ordering and receiving the replacements. In addition, by spending a Hero Point, you can immediately access backup gear worth up to one rank of Equipment or one point's worth of Removable discounts (so, 5 PP of Equipment or Removable devices or 2.5 PP of Easily Removable devices) per rank of your Wealth advantage.

  Most Dream Team mercenaries have at least Wealth 2 from salary, and people with elite skills of their own can easily reach Wealth 3\.

  **Notable Organizations of Other Countries**

  **The Association of Technomancers (Limbra):** The Association of Technomancers are a loose affiliation of technomancers who dedicate a substantial amount of their time to maintaining, expanding, and in some cases moderating the Matrix. They are unified in their belief of a free Matrix, one not controlled by the government or any big corporations, but beyond that they're a rather loose network. There's no official leadership to the Association, but there are "celebrities" who rise to (and fall from) prominence based on their work, knowledge, or just popularity, and their words often have sway with significant followings. The Association largely polices itself, meaning that if any one individual or faction seems to be gaining too much influence, others will usually step in to rein them in. The Association does have a fairly thriving counter-culture element, some of whom take their ideals to more extreme levels, seeking to use the power of the Matrix to bring down big corporations and even governments.

  At their best, the Association of Technomancers are a group that volunteers to maintain the greatest technological and information resource in Limbra (and probably the world), for no profit and often at personal expense, so that everyone has equal use of the Matrix. At their worst, they're hackers and anarchists who take full advantage of both advanced technological skill and brutally powerful avatars to wreak havoc on whatever organizations attract their ire.

  **The Better World Institute (Paradisia):** The Better World Institute is the nucleus of what eventually became the nation of Paradisia. It is fair to say that no single organization has left as big a mark on the world as the Better World Institute \- although that's not necessarily a compliment, since their work has led to the Pits of the Braizen Isles and the controversial (and highly destructive to coastal cities across the globe) raising of Paradisia. Dreamer scientists with the goal of creating a Dreamer Paradise, Paradisia was a huge step in the right direction, but it's not their end goal. Current plans involve colonizing Aranth's moon as an even more secure home, and eventually the Better World Scientists hope to be able to take Dreamers to a homeworld all their own.

  At their best, the Better World Institute is a group of scientists and explorers who seek to provide Dreamers with safety and community that Mundane society cannot match. At their worst, the are obsessive Dreamer separationists who have no qualms about causing horrific collateral damage in the name of their "better world".

  **The Broken Ring (Indelar):** The Broken Ring is an underworld organization operating throughout the Free Nations of Indelar. They're thieves and criminals, no question, but to the common people of Indelar, they have a reputation as romantically dangerous folk heroes. They tend to have strong community ties, targeting big businesses and government institutions, and using a non-trivial portion of their wealth to improve the lives of the common people. They place a lot of emphasis on making sure people are able to live their lives and find some happiness even surrounded by the rigors of war. They also provide protection and even order to small communities whose normal law enforcement capability has been shattered by the war. The common people tend to view them favorably, but it's tough to say whether their hearts really are in the right place, or whether they just use great PR to bolster their influence and opportunity for personal profit \- they give a lot back to their communities, but they also keep at least as much for themselves. And the problem with targeting businesses and governments in a war like the one Indelar is in, is that the resources they steal are very often needed for the countries' defense.

  At their best, the Broken Ring is a Robin Hood style band that keep the corporations and governments of Indelar from using the war as an excuse to extract resources from their people, and offer the common folk protection against more dangerous criminals. At their worst, they're profiteering thieves who happily make Haptarus' job easier in the name of lining their own pockets.

  **The Champions' Guild (Dymara):** The term "champion" is used in Dymara in a much similar way as the term "hero" is used in Ilessia. There are regular, day-to-day champions, the people who step up to settle conflicts for those in need. There are professional champions, people whose job it is to represent others in civil, commercial, and legal conflicts. And then there are the capital-C Champions, master martial artists who fight in the name of causes they believe in and step up to defend people threatened by dangerous Dreamers or rogue Chi masters. These skilled warriors are members of the Champion's Guild, an organization that offers combat training, assistance in judging worthy causes, companionship, and moderation and regulation for formal duels and Challenges. And tournaments, of course. The Champion's Guild are big, big fans of epic martial arts tournaments. (Spoiler alert: so is the rest of Dymara \- Champion Guild martial arts tournaments are pretty much the top sporting entertainment in the Four Kingdoms, and Dymarans can get *fiercely* competitive when it comes to rooting for their nation's Champions in the annual Grand Martial Arts Tournament).

  At their best, the Champion's Guild is an organization of down-to-earth heroes who fight to defend the weak and protect the innocent, ever following the ideal that right makes might. At their worst, they are mighty warriors made arrogant by their power, who believe that the only laws that apply to them are the laws of the Challenge.

  **The Children of Paradise (Paradisia):** The Children of Paradise and the Better World Institute are two sides of the same coin. Originally a loose global political organization promoting Dreamer separation, with the raising of Paradisia they've largely evolved into Paradisia's recruitment network. They operate the Welcome to Paradise Travel Agency, which offers Dreamers transport to Paradisia. While many means of travel are available, their most iconic are their luxury cruise ships. They also maintain Dreamer-exclusive resorts throughout the world, giving Dreamers the opportunity to experience Dreamer-only society while they are still not ready to leave Mundane society permanently. They also maintain the controversial Protectors of Paradise \- elite units of Paradisian warriors who travel abroad in defense of Dreamers, sometimes even whisking imperiled Dreamers to the safety of Paradisia.

  At their best, the Children of Paradise provide an opportunity for Dreamers to gradually make the transition to Dreamer-exclusive society, and provide valuable assistance and support to both Dreamers who are making the transition and the Mundane loved ones they are leaving behind. At their worst, they are aggressive separationists who will stop at nothing to "protect" Dreamers from Mundane society \- whether they like it or not.

  **The Confederation (Indelar):** The Confederation is a military and political organization that promotes the unification of the Free Nations into a single confederation, with centralized leadership and united people. The Confederation has existed in some form or another for a while, but it's only with the war with Haptarus that it truly began gaining prominence. Full unification is their goal, but until then they promote coordination, mutual aid, open borders, and strong military alliances.

  At their best, the Confederation is a voice for unity against the threat of Haptarus, and a movement seeking to take the disparate, often-conflicting Indelan nations and turn them into a single great country on par with Ilessia and Limbra. At their worst, they are just another route to the same goal as Haptarus seeks, and a strain on each individual country's attention and military strength.

  **The Domestic Reserve (Peral):** There are totemic rites that can in certain circumstances bond a Beast to a Hunter as a companion. The Domestic Reserve is not about people who use that rite. The Domestic Reserve is an organization operating throughout Peral that works to domesticate, control, and profit from the megafauna the inhabits the continent. They acquire and train the Beasts of Peral just as if they were any normal animal and put them to work in a variety of ways, from showing them off in great zoos and controlled habitats to using them for labor and transportation to, in some cases, even butchering them to sell as extravagant food. It's a risky job, but one that offers tremendous rewards for those brave enough to undertake it.

  At their best, the Domestic Reserve is an organization of Hunters and rangers that offer protection from Perallan communities while simultaneously preserving the amazing megafauna of their homeland by turning dangerous Beasts into useful contributors to society. At their worst they are heartless poachers who exploit some of the most impressive specimens of natural life on Aranth for their own personal profit.

  **The Ice Water Mercenary Company (The Braizen Isles):** Ever since the power of the Pits was discovered, they have been a source of conflict in the Braizen Isles. Such conflict has opened the way for many mercenary companies, the largest of which is the Ice Water Mercenary Company. Disciplined, organized, and well-equipped with a combination of regular, Dream, and Pit Tech, they operate throughout the isles guarding and taking holdings. The Ice Water Mercenary Company follows a strict code of conduct, with the \#1 rule being that they will not fight one another or anyone employing them. This strict rule and their growing scope is actually contributing significantly to a decline in armed conflict throughout the Isles. Of course, this also means that any clients who cease paying their fees will again have to concern themselves with the possibility of an Ice Water force ousting them from their holdings...

  At their best, the Ice Water Mercenary Company is a loyal, unfailingly professional company of warriors who will not betray or forsake their (current) clients for any price, and who actively work to minimize armed conflict throughout their area of influence, even though they charge far more for active combat than passive protection. At their worst, they are an elaborate protection racket who force their employers to keep paying them or risk losing everything as soon as their contract expires.

  **The International Trade Association (Peral):** Peral doesn't have much in the way of central political organization, which among other things means no central government to negotiate trade deals with other nations, set tariffs, control currency, and otherwise represent the continent's businesses to other nations. The International Trade Association developed to fill this niche. They control pretty much all aspects of trade between Peral and other nations, and most internal trade as well. Run by a board of slick businesspeople and shrewd negotiators, their slogan is "We Always Make The Best Deal\!" Of course, whether that means the best deal for all parties involved, for the Perallans they represent, or for themselves is, shall we say, debatable.

  At their best, the International Trade Association is an absolutely critical organization that allows Peral to trade effectively with other nations, ensuring that they get fair deals and keeping the continent's economy stable. At their worst, they are consummate middlemen who will pad their profits from both sides of the deal, regularly taking advantage of their own people and very probably complicit in Peral's overall energy shortage.

  **The Knights of the Empire (Haptarus):** The Knights of the Empire are an order of Haptaran warriors devoted to the nation (now the Empire) of Haptarus. As a point of pride and honor, they've always sworn loyalty to the nation, *not* necessarily its ruler, although they follow the orders of the latter when they are in service to the former. Nonetheless, they are not particularly enamored of the current Emperor \- they have been known to always refer to him by such titles as "our current Emperor" or "the current ruler" or such \- rarely just the Emperor, and *never* as just Haptarus. They cleave to a strict code of honor, and fight strictly in defense of their home, never aggressively in conquest. While they will strike down traitors or attackers without qualm, they see themselves as defenders of the Haptaran people, and will fulfill this role even if it means defending them from the law enforcement and military personnel of their own nation. When they do travel abroad, it is usually to protect Haptaran assets, or for diplomatic purposes \- their well-established code of honor, refusal to engage in offensive military actions, and general dislike of the Emperor makes them acceptable envoys to most other countries, even in Indelar. For whatever reason, the Emperor has not disbanded or destroyed them \- probably because their combat skill and diplomatic ability make them worth the trouble they sometimes cause, but there are rumors that for some reason the Emperor fears them to some degree, and does not wish to risk a conflict with them. Given who the Emperor is, this seems...unlikely, and the Knights themselves have never claimed to hold any leverage over him. So it's probably just wishful thinking.

  At their best, the Knights of the Empire are one of the few truly moral units in the Haptaran military, patriots who serve their nation with pride and honor even through this dark time in its history, with a vision of brighter futures ahead. At their worst, they are just another group of Haptaran goons who deserve only more scorn for professing any sort of ethical standards when they support a ruler as monstrously evil as the Emperor.

  **The National Competitive Sporting Committee (Limbra):** When people think of Limbra, they usually think about the country's enormous tech industry and its iconic Matrix. But that doesn't mean Limbrans spend all their time sitting at computers. In fact, sports entertainment is about as big in Limbra as movies are in Ilessia. The National Competitive Sporting Committee is an overarching privately-run institution that controls the vast majority of Limbran sporting events. They're one of the biggest industries in Limbra, running everything from producers of sporting equipment, to little league operations, all the way to huge stadiums and national events. They wield a lot of power, not just from their political lobby, but also from controlling advertisers, branding, and athlete endorsements, giving them an uncanny ability to sway the minds of Limbra's extensive collection of sports enthusiasts. There's a persistent but well-hidden dark side to the organization though; they also run an extensive gambling operation that goes well beyond mere entertainment, and one of Limbra's most powerful crime families has a strong presence in the company, regularly using it to launder money or for even darker ends.

  At their best, they're one of the proudest corporations in the world, providing entertainment, scholarships, and all manner of sporting goods and events to generations of Limbrans. At their worst, they're a terrifyingly powerful megacorp with fingers in more than a few illicit pies, and which is entirely capable of exploiting both professional and young athletes, as well as their extensive network of followers, to improve their bottom line.

  **The Northmark Academy (Dymara):** Several hundred miles to the north of the continent of Dymara is a large island. Held by the Dymaran kingdoms for centuries, this is the isle of Northmark, and home to the most prestigious school in the Four Kingdoms. The Northmark Academy provides normal education from grade school to masters level, but its primary purpose is a place to hone one's mastery of Chi. Separated from the distractions of the mainland, students study, meditate, practice, and spar with monastic discipline, foregoing luxuries to achieve personal mastery. Even esoteric disciplines, such as ninjutsu or the use of Chi in harnessing Dreamer powers, are taught in Northmark. The Academy is divided into eight colleges, between whom is fostered a fierce competition. The Academy does not only accept Dymaran students, but they are by far the most common. That said, people from all over the world seek entry into the school to learn the secrets of Chi.

  At their best, the Northmark Academy is a premiere institution for the practice of Chi, and a common source of great Champions and warriors for the kingdoms of Dymara. At their worst, the Northmark Academy is isolated and uncaring of the outside world, and offers great secrets of Chi manipulation to any who show promise \- regardless of what they intend to use their lessons for.

  **The Secret Wardens (Haptarus):** The Secret Wardens are an underground organization of spies, smugglers, and saboteurs operating throughout Haptarus, and all of Indelar to a lesser extent. They have no loyalties but to credits. They are an extensive part of the Emperor's intelligence network, bringing him information from all corners of his Empire, but they also smuggle information, goods, and even people out of Haptarus \- for the right price. This is risky business \- Haptarus has no qualms about executing such smugglers (and/or their entire families) if they get caught. The prices are commensurate, and given the perils of life in Haptarus for those who most need to leave it, it should come as little surprise that these prices are subject to spontaneous increase.

  At their best, the Secret Wardens are a life-saving underground railroad who get people in peril out of Haptarus at great personal risk, and a valuable source of intelligence for the Free Nations. At their worst, they are spies, liars, and human traffickers who show no loyalty to anyway, exploiting the phenomenal leverage their services provide to take advantage of people in desperate need.

  **The Tribe (Braizen Isles):** Those mutated by Braizen Pit radiation have a hard enough lot in life from the often painful or debilitating physical mutations, dependence on Pit energy for survival, and shortened lifespans. As if that weren't bad enough...they're not exactly popular. Many Braizen cities treat mutants as second-class citizens at best, social pariahs at worst, and some are even evicted altogether. But the Tribe offers outcast mutants support, community, and a home. The Tribe is a community of mutants, many of which travel nomadically, but just as many of which are scattered throughout Braizen settlements and communities, offering shelter and support for their fellow mutants. The Tribe responds to hatred with hatred; they have a strongly anti-"human" disposition (they do not consider themselves humans, whatever they were before mutating, and would generally be offended if someone tried to categorize them as such), and have little fear about clashing violently with humans for resources or territory. Mutants of the tribe also tend to have a strong resentment towards Dreamers.

  At their best, the Tribe is a much-needed community and support network for the mutants of the Braizen Isles, providing them with a home and with help dealing with their new circumstances, as well as a way to use any beneficial mutations they may develop for a public benefit. At their worst, they are violent extremists who use the bigotry of others to justify their own murderous impulses.  
  A role playing game is three things. It is an interactive story, a game of chance, and a process in critical thinking.

  **Major Religions**

  The following is an overview of the most significant religions in Aranth. This isn't to say they are the *only* ones, but they're the ones that have major followings throughout at least one country. Along with an overview of the religions themselves, each one includes a major Blessing. These Blessings are permanent augmentations, generally placed upon devoted followers by the highest priests or faithful. Each religion naturally claims that its Blessings are supernatural miracles of its subject of worship, and there are legends regarding many of the Blessings from long in the past. However, it's impossible not to note that each of the people capable of placing these blessings are, themselves, Dreamers. Although each one has different powers and there's not any confirmed evidence that the ability to place the Blessings are a Dreamer power...it's tough to be sure.

  In addition to major Blessings, the devoutly faithful sometimes have been known to perform extraordinary, or even supernatural, feats purely through their faith. These tend to be fairly subtle powers, either personal in nature or difficult to really observe, so it's hard to study them conclusively. Many dismiss them as mere myth, some say it's some crude manipulation of Spiritual Energy, and of course, the faithful say it's divine miracle (when members of their religions do it, at least).

  **The Arch-Faith:** The Arch-Faith is monotheistic, believing in a singular deity who created and controls all of reality, who goes by the name of Arch (pronounced "Arc"). Arch is, as far as we mortals may as well be concerned, omnipotent and omniscient. With a bare amount of effort, he could utterly duplicate, change, and/or destroy every particle of every bit of matter or energy that is in any way connected to our planet.

  That said, he created, controls, and continues to expand on not just our tiny little world, but the entire universe, which is a project of mind-bogglingly massive scale. The Arch-Faith is quite adamant that there exists life on other worlds beyond our own, and the universe itself is so tremendous even before life that maintaining and even adding to it requires simply a colossal amount of effort and energy at all times. That being said, Arch has not only provided everything that the human race and other living creatures of the world need to survive and thrive, but he still pays attention, still watches over us, hears our prayers, and is interested in our lives.

  The personality ascribed to Arch is that of the perennial creator. He devises entire worlds, sets them on a certain evolutionary path or just outright creates inhabitants, and likes to see what happens from there. He's interested on both the macro and micro scale, watching with equal interest the rise and fall of civilizations over centuries and the day-to-day lives of mortal men and women. That said, every world that he creates, he assigns himself a different set of rules for his future interactions with it, and every soul he creates is given a choice what sort of world it will go to.

  On some worlds, Arch uses his powers freely to influence the lives of his creations. Some worlds receive only beneficial influence, some only detrimental, and some it varies. On other worlds, his influence can be requested (which may involve rituals of various levels of complexity, or specific deeds, or bloodlines, or whatever other rules he chooses for that world). Other worlds have very limited, or even outright no influence beyond creation.

  One of the biggest debates among factions of the Arch-Faith is just how much influence Arch has given himself over Aranth. The sects run the gamut from "everything that happens is part of Arch's careful planning" to "Arch created us and leaves us to our own devices, watching impassively but never interfering." And they hit everything in between. This often makes them seem to be a much more fractitious religion than the Deionists (who tend to have fewer large-scale disagreements, and more just focus their worship on different gods or even divine servitors).

  The Arch-Faith categorically denies mysticism and cosmology. Arch doesn't have minions or servitors (although they note that his creations on certain worlds could very well be similar or identical to popular or other religious depictions of certain fantastic creatures). There isn't some opposing cosmic force of evil or entropy in their teachings. Arch-Faithful don't believe in a spiritual afterlife, but rather that when a person dies, its soul returns to Arch and is sent to a new life on a new world, once again allowed to choose how much influence it would like Arch to have over its life. Basically, where the cosmic scale is concerned, there is Arch, the Universe he created, and that's that, with nothing else in existence even coming vaguely close to approximating the barest fraction of his power or influence.

  The concept of *choice* is central to the moral teachings of the Arch-Faith. One thing that is universally agreed upon among the Arch-Faithful is that Arch never directly compels mortal will (although perhaps the greatest divide among the Faithful is the question of whether he *could* but never does, or whether it is beyond even his power \- if the act of giving free will to mortals required him to forfeit his ability to influence it). The moral lessons of the Arch-Faith emphasize the power of a choice, and the importance of making the right choices when faced with them. Naturally, this includes the choice of whether or not to believe in Arch. This ethos has given members of the Arch-Faith a reputation for being...not intolerant, quite, but judgmental. They have a tendency to have strong opinions on what is the right choice in make in a given situation and have rather little qualm about making those opinions known. They see it as a sacred duty to help guide people to the right choice by providing them relevant information they may be lacking, and they see prayer as a way to seek guidance from Arch in making one's choices.

  *That* said, it is a central tenet of their faith that the choice remains the sacred right of the chooser \- although the consequences of their choice are also their own to reap. They are not fond of the idea of compelling or coercing others to choose in the way they do not wish to, even if it would be better for them. As should be no surprise, they find Dreamer powers that are capable of subverting the wills of others to be absolutely abhorrent.

  The Arch-Faith is one of the biggest religions on the planet, with only Deionism really on the same scale, although the Seekers of the Dream are catching up surprisingly rapidly. It competes with Deionism for dominance in Ilessia, Limbra, the Braizen Isles, and Indelar (with Ilessia weighted a bit towards the Arch-Faith, and Limbra a bit towards Deionism). It also has a significant, but not as dominant, following in Peral, Dymara, and even Haptarus, though worship of anything other than the Emperor is banned in the latter.

* **Spoiler: The Arch-Guided**

  In the city of Lastelle in Ilessia is one of the oldest and grandest churches of Arch \- the Shining Cathedral, which is led by the High Priest of the Arch-Faith, Germaine Thorn. A Dreamer with the power of Nigh Invulnerability, he is also capable of bestowing the Blessing of Arch upon the Faithful.

  Those seeking the Blessing of Arch do so when faced with a critical choice that can define the course of not just their own lives, but others as well. They travel to the Shining Cathedral to speak with High Priest Thorn, discussing at length the choice and its ramifications. They are then sent to study the choice, and all possible options, in great detail \- often to the exclusion of almost all other pursuits, and usually for at least a year, although some have studied for as much as five years or even a decade. When they have learned all they can, if they have not yet been able to come to a decision, they return to the Cathedral, discuss the matter once more with Thorn, and if he deems it appropriate, they receive the Blessing over the course of twenty-four hours of silent contemplation.

  Recipients of the Blessing have spoken often about the sense of utter certainty and clarity that comes with it. It's not that they feel a compulsion or desire to choose a certain way, it's just that the best choice suddenly becomes clear and easy to make. In the future, they find the ramifications of their choices easy to predict, and manipulating their choices becomes extremely difficult for others. None who have received the Blessing have ever expressed even the slightest doubt that they have been the recipients of divine guidance from an omniscient source.

  **Guidance of Arch:** Senses 4 (Precognition; Limited \[Only to discern the results of own choices\]) {2}.

  **Feel the Truth:** Senses 4 (Ranged Acute Radius Tactile Detect \[Truth\]) {4}.

  **Blessed Perceptions:** Enhanced Perception 8 (Limited \[Only for purposes of Guidance of Arch and Feel the Truth\]), Senses 2 (Vision Counters Illusion) {4}.

  **Unfettered Choice:** Immunity 5 (Mind Control) {5}.

  **The Deionists:** The second of Aranth's two largest religions is collectively referred to as Deionism, a polytheistic and heavily mystical tradition. Its stories are where you'll find the foundation for lot of Earth's mythological and fantasy concepts and creatures \- angels, demons, dragons, elves, fairies, vampires, even eldritch abominations. Most of those have been co-opted by numerous fiction and fantasy writers over the years, and for many, the popular depictions don't much resemble the religious depictions at all, but a sizable majority of such concepts at least originated from Deionic traditions.

  The core concept of Deionism is that there are numerous gods, each with their own sphere of influence. It places a lot of emphasis on morality, though the gods themselves are never inherently good or evil. Rather, each deity's sphere comprises a balance between positive and negative extremes, and the big premise is that mortal actions collectively influence the nature of the gods. Murder, war, and other violent killings, for example, subtly alters the nature of the Promise towards death, which also increases the overall amount of death in the world. Likewise, protecting, preserving, and creating life alters the Promise towards life. The core teaching is that a perfectly moral society would greatly reduce or even utterly eliminate the negative aspects of the gods, resulting in a perfect world.

  Prayer to individual gods doesn't strengthen them, but does have influence. The idea is less that you're requesting a personal favor, more that you're focusing your will towards tipping the balance in hopes that you'll see benefit. For example, when a Deionist prays to the Drive for success, they aren't really expecting the Drive to consciously reach down and bless them with success, but rather hoping to make success in general just that much more common throughout the world, in hopes that it will trickle down to make them more likely to accomplish what they want. Prayer can be both positive and negative, although negative prayer is officially heavily frowned upon (since the "goal" is to remove the negative aspects of the gods and the world, and the negative can spill over onto you just as easily). That said, people aren't perfect, and they can and do pray for negative effects to befall competitors or enemies.

  The afterlife is also extensively discussed in Deionism. The gods exist in a different realm, where mortal souls travel upon death. Mortals devoted to a given deity may be reincarnated as servants of that deity \- the various fictional creatures. The nature of the mortal's soul, however, also has an influence on that realm and all the gods and beings within it \- a mortal who dies having done a great deal of evil brings more negative energy to the gods, while one who has done a great deal of good brings more positive energy. Likewise, the form one is reincarnated in will depend on the person's nature.

  There are eight "main" gods, each of which has several demigods beneath it (and naturally, the number eight has a special significance to Deionists; on Aranth, the symbol of infinity looking like a sideways 8 comes from them). Below them are angels and demons \- embodiments of specific positive or negative ideals, waging a constant cosmic war against each other, the "personalized" representation of the conflict in each deity. Below them are the reincarnates, the various mythological creatures created of former mortal souls. Each full-fledged god has its own unique type of reincarnates, while demigods, angels, and demons serve all gods, though their ideals and spheres of influence are related to the deity they serve. The full-fledged gods tend to be viewed as more sentient energy beings, fairly abstract, though they occasionally are said to manifest more human-like avatars. Demigods tend to have more humanoid forms, names, and personalities.

  Deionism is more-or-less as prominent a religion as the Arch-Faith, spread throughout the world to largely the same degree. While the two religions have never been outright hostile to each other on any sort of large scale \- religious conflicts have happened in the past, but nothing like major inquisitions or holy wars or such \- they are long-standing rivals. They both do see worship of other religions as a sort of moral failing, and they're in disagreement on a lot of points. Indeed, in some cases, they disagree seemingly for the sake of being contrary to each other \- Deionists tend to take the stance that there isn't life on other planets, not so much because it's a particularly important tenet of their religion, but because extraterrestrial life is a big belief of the Arch-Faith. Likewise, a lot of the Arch-Faith's rejection of fantastic and supernatural beings is a contrast with Deionism, since there's not really any reason Arch couldn't create such beings.

* **Spoiler: The Eight Deities**  
* Hide  
  **The Drive of Success and Failure:** The Drive governs all forms of accomplishment, or failure thereof. Success, achievement, luck, and beneficial results are its positive forces, while failure, surrender, ill fortune, and negative results are its negative forces. People pray to the Drive to help them accomplish their goals, or to cause their enemies or opponents failure. Demigods, angels, and demons serving the Drive embody various forms of success and failure \- an Angel of Triumph, for example, would represent victory in direct competition, while the Demigod of Luck would hold sway over fortune.

  **The Fate of Purpose and Insigificance:** The Fate governs purpose and meaning, or its lack. Its portfolio includes willpower, goals, destiny, and fate, as well as sloth, apathy, meaninglessness, and worthlessness. While the Drive holds sway over achieving one's goals, the Fate holds sway over having goals and knowing what you are meant to do. People pray to the Fate to find purpose in life, to overcome their own laziness or inhibitions...or for a reprieve from their responsibilities. Servitors of the Fate often embody the destinies of large groups; each country, for example, is said to have a demigod that rules over its peoples' shared destiny.

  **The Gift of Gain and Loss:** The Gift governs acquisition and loss both tangible and intangible. Wealth, power, fame, prestige, material luxuries, and so on. People pray to the Gift because they want more, or to remove things that they feel others do not deserve. Interesting trivia fact, positive prayers to the Gift typically vastly outnumber negative prayers, but more recently that's been less true as a lot of people, especially those associated with the Reclaimers, have been praying for the removal of Dreamer powers. It's actually starting to scare some of the church elders... Servitors of the Gift represent specific forms of gain, a Demigod of Wealth or Angel of Business, for example.

  **The Heart of Joy and Pain:** While Joy and Pain are called out explicitly, the Heart holds sway over all emotions, positive and negative. Joy, hope, calm, love, pain, fear, rage, hate, and more besides. People pray to the Heart to find love, or for pleasant things to happen, or for control over their negative emotions...or to inflict dark emotions on those they dislike. Servitors of the Heart represent individual emotions or facets thereof, Demigods of Love or Rage, Angels of Valor, Demons of Vengeance, and so on.

  **The Lore of Knowledge and Ignorance:** The Lore holds sway over all knowledge \- scientific, mystical, historical, and so on. Ignorance, inaccuracy, and foolishness are the results of its negative energy, and the official word is that belief in other religious systems (or simple disbelief in the gods) is a force of negative energy towards the Lore. Prayers to the Lore are for enlightenment and understanding, or negatively, for secrecy or confusion. Servitors of the Lore govern specific areas of knowledge, such as a Demigod of Science or Magic.

  **The Nature of Balance and Chaos:** The Nature governs the balance of the natural forces of the universe. Light and dark, heat and cold, matter and energy, space and time, nature and civilization, and so on. These are not individually positive and negative, however. The "positive" energy of the Nature comes from the balance among these forces, where they exist in harmony and do what they are supposed to do, fulfilling the natural order and allowing for life to flourish. The "negative" of Nature is chaos among these forces, where they become unpredictable, destructive, and dangerous. The fire of a family's hearth is Balance, while a raging wildfire consuming that same family's home is Chaos. Prayers to the Nature are typically to tweak the balance in some way \- a breeze on a hot day, for example, or simply to quell disasters or similar expressions of Chaos. Of course, negative prayers to beset others with uncomfortable, hazardous, or deadly Chaos also exist. Servitors of the Nature represent individual natural forces, such as a Demigod of Fire or Angel of Warmth.

  **The Promise of Life and Death:** The Promise controls life and death, and by extension, thing such as health and sickness, and other things that influence the state of life. People pray to the Promise to keep themselves, their loved ones, or their fellow people alive in hazardous situations, to restore health to the sick and injured, and so on. Negative prayers to the Promise for the death of one's enemies and such are considered the second most horrible abuses of prayer in the religion. Similar to the Fate, servitors of the Promise tend to represent groups of living beings, but can extend down to individuals \- every living soul, it is said, has its own angel.

  **The Truth of Right and Wrong:** The Truth encompasses moral and ethical action. Compassion, honor, mercy, tyranny, treachery, oppression, and so on. Prayers to the Truth are typically for guidance as to the right thing to do, and many call the Truth the most important of the gods, for it is the Truth who shows mortals how to best act to bring out the best in their deities (the scriptures say that it was the Truth who originally made mortals aware of the gods and their natures). Likewise, negative prayers to the Truth are considered the worst one can give, even beyond prayers for Death, as they explicitly mean you are actively and intentionally praying for what is definitionally wrong or evil. Servitors of the Truth are embodiments of the highest and most base ideals, such as Angels of Virtue and Demons of Corruption.

* **Spoiler: The Anointed Pilgrims**  
* Hide  
  Legend goes that in the ages before recorded history, the Truth feared that the newly-created race of humankind would be a force of negative energy. Although the Deities were for good or ill embodiments of both their positive and their negative aspects, the Truth knew that their positive aspects were Right, and their negative aspects were Wrong, and that it was their duty to the world and peoples they had created to ensure that they knew the importance of the difference. From all throughout the world, they called people to gather, coming by foot or by steed or by ship to meet in an open section of wilderness in...more-or-less the middle of nowhere in the mid-southern region of the continent of Aldonis.

  Beckoned by the call of the gods, thousands made their way to the gathering. They shared food and drink and stories, played games of sport and chance and discussed their homes and their philosophies. For eight days this gathering of strangers celebrated together like family.

  And for eight nights, the first eight people who had arrived there experienced vivid dreams. Into their Hearts the gods played the Lore of Nature, giving them the Gift of revealing their Fate. And when they awoke on the eighth day, filled with a divine Drive, the eight made a sacred Promise to spread throughout the world the Truth. They spoke of what they had seen to the others gathered, and then together with a small group of followers went on a journey, travelling by foot or by steed or by boat, across Aldonis and Dymara and Peral and Indelar. And one by one they found a place where they would construct a temple, and spent a day celebrating with their fellows, before bidding them farewell to begin their work.

  By the end of the year, they had staked their claims, and they returned to where the gathering had been held one year from their original arrival, where they found in over the time they had been travelling, those who they had left behind had constructed a great temple to the Eight Deities, the Gathering Home. And so four eight days they feasted and talked and celebrated. This eight day period is now known as the Feast of the Gods, the highest of Deionist holidays. And throughout the world there still stand the eight High Temples, one to each of the deities, and the day each was founded remains a major Deionist holiday as well.

  Most practicing Deionists seek to visit at least the Gathering Home and the High Temple of their favored deity at least once in their lives. Many seek to visit all of the High Temples at some point. But a rare few embark on the traditional pilgrimage. Spending the Feast of the Gods at the Gathering Home, on the eighth day they receive the blessing of High Priestess Catrin Kirchner, a Dreamer with the power of Aeromancy, and begin their journey. Travelling only by foot or by steed or by boat, they journey to all eight High Temples, spending the founding holiday of each one at the temple, receiving blessings from the priests there and performing rites. The journey ends when they return to the Gathering Home on the first day of the Feast of the Gods, regaling the faithful gathered there with stories of their pilgrimage and participating in prayer and rituals. On the eighth day, if they have completed their pilgrimage truly as the Founders had before, the High Priestess places the final blessing upon them. Thereafter, they are known as an Anointed Pilgrim, and their devotion to the Eight Deities shines through as an endless font of positive energy that sooths pain and troubles for all around them.

  **Font of Positive Energy:** Regeneration 5 (Affects Self and Others, Burst Area, Sustained, Feature \[Can soothe general stress and emotional distress\], Quirk \[Doesn't provide actual healing for targets other than the Pilgrim itself, just soothes pain and allows targets to ignore the mechanical effects of healed conditions\], Feature/Quirk \[Aura Effect; does not need to be used separately on targets, once activated simply affects all within 30' of the user for as long as they remain within the area\]).

  **Seekers of the Dream:** The Seekers of the Dream are the newest major religion on the planet, but in their short lifespan of just 115 years, they have already grown to become one of the largest religions in the world, competing even with the Arch-Faith and the Deionists. The Seekers are a rather factionated religion, with a lot of variations between sects and even individual churches, but at the core of their belief system is the idea that Dreamer powers are divinely bestowed, and that *all* people have the potential for such powers. The specifics of the divine will behind Dreamers is a hotly debated subject among various sects, and sects that combine the teachings of the Seekers with those of the Arch-Faith, the Deionists, the Disciples of the Way, and various Perallan shamanic traditions have all achieved significant followings. The biggest sect, though, are the Seekers of the Eternal Dream, who don't cleave to any other religious tradition and instead worship "the Dream" itself as a divine entity. Even those who don't subscribe to this belief, though, will often use "the Dream" as a sort of unifying word for subjects of worship; for example, a Seeker of the Arch-Faith and a Seeker of the Gods might both refer to "the Dream" when discussing philosophy as a sort of short-hand for, "Okay, one of us believes Arch bestows the Dream, the other believes the Eight Deities do, but regardless we agree that one of them does and that's who we're talking about."

  Much of the information in this section is a sort of weighted aggregate. All of the details below are subject to variation in different sects, but there's almost no sects who disagree on every point, and most of them agree on several.

  The Seekers of the Dream are a new religion that rose to prominance in an age of scientific knowledge and enlightenment. This strongly informs their operations. They don't stand as much as many other religions do on tradition and ritual, and weirdly enough, actually don't place particular emphasis on faith. They do recognize that their core premise requires faith in a greater power, but beyond that, they see discerning the will of the Dream as more an exercise in observation and deduction. They don't have ancient legends and holy books that are supposed to tell you what the Dream is thinking; they try to figure it out from their observations on how the Dreamer phenomenon works. This is why they call themselves Seekers \- they don't profess to have been given knowledge from on high, but they are seeking the will of the Dream by studying its works. They generally tend to be less formal and steeped in tradition than other religions (although the sects that tie into other religions naturally borrow a lot of their mysticism).

  A major tenet of their faith is responsibility, the idea that Dreamers were given their powers for a reason. They note that the Dream does not manipulate or rescind the powers once given, which they say goes to mean that for good or ill, what a Dreamer does with its powers is its own responsibility. The Dream won't punish for wrong choices, but that doesn't mean Dreamers can do whatever they want without regard for consequences. If anything, it only makes it more important for Dreamers to understand what their powers are meant for, and how to use them well and properly.

  The Seekers tend to believe in reincarnation. They see Spiritual Energy as literally energy produced by a person's spirit, and when the person dies the spirit can move on to another life, growing each time. They often tie the idea of everyone having potential to become a Dreamer to reincarnation; they observe that Dreamers were much more rare and evidently less powerful in the past, whereas the total number of Dreamers and the proportion of powerful ones has been rising recently. They conclude, thus, that spirits need to grow through a certain number of lives to be ready for Dreamer powers, and we've simply reached the point where more and more spirits are becoming ready. They speculate that it won't be so very many generations before everyone is a Dreamer. There is also a persistent minority theory, especially common in Paradisia, that says that once you have your Dream you are on your "last life" so to speak. While this emphasizes the need to to the best you can with your powers and maximize the positive impact they have, some adherents to it believe it invests Dreamers with a greater moral weight than Potentials.

  Another big point the Seekers tend to emphasize is the community of Dreamers. While they don't (usually) set Dreamers above Potentials, they do recognize a strong connection between them, a shared responsibility and community. They believe the Dream has a reason behind giving Dreamers their powers, but not just a reason for individual Dreamers, a reason to gift these miracles upon them as a whole. There's also a pragmatic end to it; however understanding they may be, a Potential can't really get what the Dreamer experience is about and how it impacts a person's life like other Dreamers can, and the Seekers strive to remind the Dreamer community of that and build their bonds with each other.

  Worldwide, the Seekers are only slightly less prominent than the Arch-Faith and the Deionists, and easily slot in as the third largest religion in the world. They are by far the dominant religion in Paradisia, and in fact, ordained Seekers of the Dream are the only Mundanes allowed to travel to and even live in Paradisia. In large part, this is because evidence of their "miracles" is visible on the streets every day. It's one thing to say some omnipotent being or beings is literally responsible for everything but doesn't really interact with us at all despite caring a lot about us for sure we promise. It's quite another thing to say, "Hey, this obviously supernatural phenomenon? Yeah, we're pretty sure there's a divine being behind it, and I bet if we study it hard enough we can figure out what they're trying to tell us." Of course, it doesn't hurt that their "everyone has the potential to be a Dreamer" stance can easily be misconstrued as "join our church and pay a monthly tithe and you'll eventually get superpowers\!" An entirely unintentional misunderstanding, no doubt.

* **Spoiler: The Blessed Seekers**  
* Hide  
  Any Dreamer is welcome to make a pilgrimage to the Temple of the Blessed in Paradisia to meet with Earl Winters, the High Seeker, and receive the Blessing of the Dream. As is common for the Seekers, they don't put a bunch of ritual rigamorale around it \- Winters is absolutely clear that while the Blessing is a gift from the Dream, it is part of his Dreamer power to be able to channel this blessing to other Dreamers (his power overall is general Dreamer metapowers \- he can influence, augment, negate, detect, and even, with high but not perfect reliability, *predict* Dreamer powers, and can sometimes trigger a power he predicts someone will eventually develop to manifest early, though he takes great caution in using that particular ability).

  While there isn't much ritual to the blessing, those who receive it have always described it as an extremely spiritual experience, and even the more skeptical among them have always left strongly believing in the divine nature of the Dream. Likewise, while the blessing doesn't require much in the way of elaborate preparation \- a Dreamer can easily get a Welcome to Paradise teleporter to pop them to Paradisia, meet Seeker Winters if his schedule allows, receive the blessing, and pop back over the course of a long afternoon \- it does come with a certain responsibility to use it to help, guide, and grow the Dreamer community. While no strict mandates are given, Earl's a good judge of character, and generally won't bestow the Blessing on those who aren't likely to use it to the betterment of Dreamers.

  **Disciples of the Way:** The principle religion in Dymara (although it edges out the Arch-Faith and Deionism by only a slim plurality, and the Seekers of the Dream are catching up) and one with scattered adherence elsewhere, the Way is of two sides of the coin to the practice of chi. Where chi is a more practical and technical study, the Way builds upon that technical foundation to develop a spiritual guideline. The central premise of the Way is that the flow of chi is not something constrained to a single individual. Spiritual Energy flows throughout the world and all its people and life. If Spiritual Energy is likened to water, then the Way teaches that each individual is not a single glass containing its own individual spirit, but more like a bubble in the vast ocean, distinct perhaps, but still just part of the whole, and subject to be moved by its tides and currents.

  All life is connected, the Way teaches. This means that all life is sacred, although it does not teach that life can never be taken. The circle of life is part of the Way, and so to hunt and kill for food and survival is permissible so long as it is done with respect and no more is taken than needs be used. Life so taken is not lost, but merely becomes part of the collective in a new way. But life lost needlessly, wasted in folly or destroyed in murder and war \- that is gone, and so the entire collective is diminished. Naturally, then, the Way teaches peace and tolerance above all else. Conflict is best handled with nonviolent resolution or passive resistance, but where this is not possible without allowing other life to be lost, swift, merciful, and nonlethal combat must serve. The warrior-monks of the Way are masterful martial artists, and their combination of technical chi training and their faith in the connectedness of all life expands on their proficiency with chi in ways that few secular masters can match.

  The Way is less about worship than about reverence and respect. It does not declare any actual god or divine entity, but it teaches that the collective of life and humanity is something to be revered \- and that that reverence is best shown by offering welcome and respect to all. The Way teaches friendship, charity, and openness as central to morality. Personal proficiency with chi is also highly regarded, as it not only builds discipline, but makes one more attuned to the flow of Spiritual Energy \- and, thus, the bond it forges between all people.

  The Disciples believe that after death, one's own spirit simply returns to the collective. While they don't quite believe in reincarnation in the traditional sense, they do hold that the energy of one's spirit will be recycled into other lives. They also believe that the consciousness remains connected to the lives it touched, watching, guiding, and even protecting friends, family, and descendants.

  While Disciples say all life is bonded, and they believe that the truly enlightened will see all bonds as equal, they also recognize that few ever achieve such clarity. For most, some bonds are indeed stronger, and the Way does not shy from that, but teaches that these bonds should be nurtured, strengthened, and so used as a focus to nurture and strengthen one's bonds to all of life. Family, friends, community, and other personal connections are emphasized as strongly important, and something that no Disciple should ever seek to lessen or forsake.

* **Spoiler: The Eternal Companions**

  Dean Adara Kenya of Northmark Academy is...possibly the greatest master of chi on the planet (and also one of the oldest living people without a confirmed immortality power). Her mastery is built on synergies within synergies. As a powerful Dreamer, she possesses a naturally high Spiritual Energy. Which she has refined through over two centuries of chi techniques. Which she has built upon with the faith-based practices expanding chi through the Way. Which she can do amazingly well because her Dreamer power is Field Manipulation \- the ability to modify energy fields around creatures or objects. Which, technically, the lifestream *counts as* (and since Dreamer powers can "prove" anything, whether or not the lifestream as posited by the Disciples of the Way is real is irrelevant \- it absolutely is as far as her power is concerned, and that's all that matters here). She is also capable of placing the Blessing of the Way upon others.

  She does not do this lightly. Recipients of the blessing must complete a two-year course at Northmark Academy to ensure they have sufficient knowledge of chi, and to give her an opportunity to observe their progress along the Way. This is a non-trivial challenge in itself, but it is expanded upon by the fact that the Blessing is not something she performs on a single person, but an entire group. Families, spouses, friends, teams, even military units \- and every member of the group must prove themselves ready for the Blessing, or she will place it on none of them.

  The Blessing connects the recipients to each other through the lifestream, deeply strengthening their bonds with each other, and so letting them better understand the true interconnectedness of humanity.

  **A Shared Experience:** Remote Sensing 20 (Visual, Auditory; Subtle 2, Limited \[Shares the senses of a Bonded Companion\], Limited \[Companion is aware of the attempt and must be willing\]).

  **Keepers of Legend and Legacy:** The shamanic traditions of Peral have passed from generation to generation, tribe to tribe, civilization to civilization, through millennia of oral tradition. While Peral is not a unified country and its people tend towards fierce independence, one thing that bonds them is their shared Legends and Legacies. The shamans and storytellers, are tasked with learning, passing on, and when appropriate, adding to the ancient tales, keeping their Legends alive throughout time.

  At its core, Perallan shamanism is remembrance taken to the level of worship. If a lot of ways, Peral is both the most and the least religious country on Aranth. The vast majority of Perallans consider themselves Keepers, and the vast majority of Keepers do not consider themselves a religion. The remembrance and the reverence is simply a part of their culture. Perallan children grow up hearing stories of the Legends and Legacies of their ancestors from their parents, who heard them from their parents, who heard them from their parents, and so on and so on reaching back centuries upon centuries.

  When a town gathers around a shaman's fire, they rarely consider it worship. It's entertainment. The great stories of the mythic heroes of the past. And yet, they treat these stories with reverence. Most Keepers look down on any effort to commit the stories to media \- more than a few people have attempted to compile books on the subject, or make some of the stories into movies, and they never do well. Tradition dictates the stories be shared from person to person. A lifeless medium cannot keep a Legend alive.

  And that is where the line between entertainment and religion gets crossed. To the Keepers, they aren't *just* telling stories, they are immortalizing the Legends and preserving their Legacies. Of course, in the process, they are also teaching cultural ideals, of bravery and glory, self-sufficiency and community, of both having a humble respect for the natural order, and the will to take one's place at the top of it. Of the unquenchable power of the human spirit that has allowed the people of Peral, even back when the greatest available technology was sticks and stones, to survive and thrive in a land ruled by monsters.

  And, more than any religion save perhaps for the Seekers of the Dream, there is undeniable and provable power behind the Keepers' beliefs. The Totemic Rites that Peral's Hunters are known for are just a few of the primitive but powerful rituals that professional shamans are capable of. These storytellers don't just pass on the tales, but they dedicate their lives to them. The Legends and Legacies of their people burn in their minds, the spirits of ancient heroes live on within them, and the skilled among the shamans can channel their power personally.

  The Keepers don't much discuss the afterlife and generally don't believe in it. You have your life, and it is all you have, so make the most of it. There is, of course, one major exception to this rule: Legends never truly die.

* **Spoiler: The Rising Legends**  
* Hide  
  Tales of ancient Legends continue to be told and retold in Peral to this very day, but this is not to say that all the great deeds were done in the past. Peral is ever a dangerous land, and new Legends can be made all the time. Often when a great deed that will leave a lasting Legacy is accomplished, word of it spreads. And sometimes, it reaches the ear of Hossam Taggart, the Elder Keeper. A Dreamer with the power of Ash Control (also a phoenix-style "rise from the ashes" immortality \- he's at least four hundred years old, although he's hinted at being much older), he's the oldest storyteller in Peral, and he's seen his share of Legends. When a great deed reaches his ear purely by word of mouth \- not by any sort of personal boasting or advertising campaign \- and impresses him, he sometimes seeks out the person and offers them a challenge. The nature of the challenge varies from person to person, but if they agree and succeed, he blesses them as a Rising Legend. For while it's considered a truism of the Keepers that Legends never truly die, no one ever said that couldn't be *literal*.

  **Rising Legend:** Immortality 5 (Feature \[Revives in prime of life\], Quirk \[Only revives if stories about their deeds continue to be widely retold\], Limited \[Body must be cremated\]), Regeneration 10 {15}.

  **Servants of the God-Emperor:** Of...course the Emperor of Haptarus has a Crazy Fanatical Doom Cult. Of-flipping-*course* he does\!

  Thing is, sad as it is to say, these guys do actually have their bona fides. They're not some crazy fanatics who just sprang up around him when he came to power. The Servants of the God-Emperor have been around for a few thousand years now. They've never been *big*, until now (and even now they're not exactly huge, but they are the only religion that's technically allowed in Haptarus currently, and they do have small cells and followings scattered liberally throughout the rest of the world). For most of their history they were your more-or-less average Crazy Fanatical Doom Cult who worshipped some great God-Emperor who will one day descend to Aranth, conquer the world in his name, rule everything for eternity, his faithful will be given great power and prestige, blah blah crap Haptarus actually kinda fits.

  The kinda scary thing is that it's not like Haptarus heard about this cult and decided, "That, that right there, that's what I want to be when I grow up\!" Or even when he named himself Emperor he declared himself the God-Emperor out of raging ego. He just did his whole conquer-half-of-Indelar thing and these guys came to him falling all over themselves to worship him and do his bidding. And Haptarus was more or less like, "Heh. Cool."

  So Haptarus just kinda happily goes along with the whole "I Am The Lord Thy God" thing while they're around. He's been clearly established to actively enjoy seeing just how far their fanatical loyalty to him goes, and has yet to find a meaningful limit. There's no evidence that he actually believes himself to be the God-Emperor or that he even much cares if he is. But the thing is, he seems to get a kick out of playing the role, and even makes major decision based on this Crazy Fanatical Doom Cult. For example, he's outlawed all other religions in Haptarus, not because he strictly has anything against them, but more-or-less because "Hey, if the alternative is worshipping me, ya'll should totally do that. Also hah look how hard it makes my little dudes cheer." As far as anyone who seriously observes the Emperor's behavior can tell, he just finds these guys amusing, and alternates between doing things they like and basically tormenting them because A) he can and B) their reactions amuse him.

  He's been known to regularly "prove" the power of their god against the faithful of other religions (i.e. casually murder some priests for giggles), and has literally drawn random prophecies out of a hat and then gone and fulfilled them *just because he can*. This becomes especially terrifying when you give their holy book a thorough read-through and realize that, if you strip out some of the allegory and update to more modern language, some of the prophecies in there sound an awful lot like genociding all non-Dreamers, sinking the continent of Peral into the ocean, and raining nuclear armageddon on the entire continent of Aldonis. The Emperor hasn't actually tried any of those, but you know, who knows what he'll pull out of the *literal hat I am not using hyperbole here* next time.

  And yes, the Crazy Fanatical Doom Cult cells in other countries have been known to commit murder and terrorism in the name of their God-Emperor. A lot of them are fairly mundane threats, but you never know when a particular cell will include, or even be made up entirely of, dangerously powerful Dreamers.

* **Spoiler: Speakers of the Emperor**  
* Hide  
  The Speakers of the Emperor are considered recipients of the God-Emperor's Blessing by his Servants. See the Speaker of the Emperor Template in the Character/NPC Templates chapter for full details. It's possible, though, that Haptarus might also provide a lesser blessing for certain Servants. If this is so, the blessing would likely consist of:

  **Emperor's Domain:** Flight 2, Senses 6 (Extended Vision Counters All Concealment) {10}.

  **Emperor's Voice:** Enhanced Deception, Intimidation, OR Persuasion 10 {5}.  
  A role playing game is three things. It is an interactive story, a game of chance, and a process in critical thinking.

  **Time in Aranth**

  **Historical Timeline**

  **N/A PA:** Obviously, this is a very broad global timeline and there's plenty of important events, conflicts, inventions, discoveries, and so on that simply aren't mentioned. Just because something isn't included in the timeline shouldn't necessarily be taken to mean that it (or something very much like it) never happened in Aranth. However, there are some points that are, in fact, omitted for a reason.

  There was never any sort of massive world-encompassing war in Aranth (although the fear is that the conflict against Haptarus will become such). There's actually been relatively few inter-continental conflicts (although there have been an inordinate number of attempts to invade Peral and start an empire upon the fertile continent. They...don't generally go swimmingly.) For the most part, though, warfare seems to happen primarily between people on the same continent, historically.

  You might notice a significant lack of civil rights type historical milestones, or for that matter things like holy wars, ethnic genocides, and other large-scale assaults on entire peoples and cultures (individual bigots and hateful sorts exist, but it's a personal flaw, not a systemic thing). This is because the people of Aranth, for the most part, somehow manage to be sane enough not to hate, attack, or discriminate against each other over countless petty, pointless differences. Good on them. The Reclaimer movement is literally the biggest instance of systemic prejudice the planet has *ever* seen (although the way Paradisia acts towards Nulls is a close second).

  **c. \-9,000 PA:** The oldest Perallan rituals and oral traditions are confirmed to have been from at least this long ago.

  **c. \-7,000 PA:** The mythic Perallan hero Aoibheann is said to have lived during this time. Tales of Aiobheann slaying Beasts with fire and lightning have led modern scholars to believe that he might have been one of the first Dreamers, though this is only speculation.

  **c. \-5,000 PA:** Oldest known written records from what are now the Kingdoms of Dymara.

  **c. \-4,500 PA:** Written records from all major regions except the Braizen Isles have been discovered from this time period (the oldest Braizen writings are not seen until over five centuries later).

  **c. \-4,400 PA:** The oldest written records of the Arch-Faith are from this period.

  **c. \-4,200 PA:** The oldest written records of the Deionists are from this period.

  **c. \-2,500 PA:** Modern scholars believe that a three-month-long conflict between two ancient states around this time marks the first occasion where the people who would eventually become the original nations of Ilessia and Limbra (before they spread to dominate their respective halves of Aldonis) went to war against each other. It evidently had something to do with a golden chicken? The translations are unclear. The really weird thing is these states were well over a thousand miles apart and there were like a dozen other proto-nations between the two of them so *how* they managed to get into a fight over the chicken(\!?) is unknown. Theories that the chicken(???\!\!\!???) possessed Dreamer powers are derided as purest speculation, especially since no instance of the Dreamer phenomenon applying to a non-human creature has ever been conclusively proven.

  **\-1,821 PA:** An old nation from the continent that will eventually be known as Dymara attempts to invade Peral and begin a new empire upon the fertile continent. It does not go swimmingly.

  **\-1,486 PA:** Queen Dymara divides her kingdom among her four children.

  **\-1,219 PA:** One of the nations that would eventually become Limbra attempts to invade Peral and begin a new empire upon the fertile continent. It does not go swimmingly.

  **\-916 PA:** One of the nations that would eventually become Ilessia attempts to invade Peral and begin a new empire upon the fertile continent. It does not go swimmingly.

  **\-878 PA:** Various conquests, alliances, treaties, unions, and so on have led to the nation of Ilessia taking on more-or-less its current form.

  **\-858 PA:** Numerous records confirm Ellen Mueller of Limbra healed injured soldiers \- including some with maimed limbs \- in the aftermath of a battle against another early Aldonian nation. Later forensic examination of the bodies of the people she healed confirms the stories. Oh, and also, Ellen herself is still walking around and occasionally even tells stories of events that took place a millennium ago. Ellen is accepted to be the first confirmed Dreamer, possessing mid-grade powers of healing, regeneration, and immortality.

  **\-793 PA:** Various conquests, alliances, treaties, unions, and so on have led to the nation of Limbra taking on more-or-less its current form.

  **\-757 PA:** The first of many wars breaks out between the modern forms Ilessia and Limbra.

  **\-672 PA:** Limbra and Kyana begin a hundred-and-twelve year long war over that dinky little island between them. The whole thing is stupid and everyone tells them so.

  **\-583 PA:** The unified Nation of Luren attempts to invade Peral and begin a new empire upon the fertile continent. It does not go swimmingly.

  **\-239 PA:** Formal treaties of peace and alliance are signed between Ilessia and Limbra.

  **\-126 PA:** The allied nations of Ilessia and Limbra attempt to invade Peral and jointly forge a new empire upon the fertile continent. It does not go swimmingly.

  **\-111 PA:** Dreamers start to become common enough that they are generally accepted to exist, although little is known about these mysterious super-powered people.

  **\-97 PA:** With the exception of Luren still being one nation, as of this year all of the current Indelan nations exist in more-or-less their current forms.

  **\-93 PA:** A major diplomatic incident between the Allied Nations of Aldonis and the Dymaran Kingdoms threatens to turn to war between the six nations, but cooler heads manage to prevail. Lots of thanks to Limbra and Veneil, very little thanks to Ilessia and Darpon.

  **\-80 PA:** The first nuclear weapon is successfully tested by Ilessia.

  **\-65 PA:** Civil War breaks out in the Indelan nation of Luren.

  **\-61 PA:** Peace treaties are signed between the new nation of East Luren and its parent nation West Luren.

  **\-33 PA:** Veneil attempts to respectfully visit Peral and form a large-scale trade agreement among a dozen of its preeminent city-states, gaining unprecedented access to fine Perallan agricultural products and begin a new mercantile empire in alliance with the fertile continent. It goes swimmingly.

  **0 PA:** The Year of the Awakening. A small group of powerful Dreamers reveal their true identities and powers to the world, forming the nucleus of what will eventually become the Assembly and beginning the process of making Dreamers a well-known and understood phenomenon in the world.

  **29 PA:** IDEA is established.

  **30 PA:** The first mecha is built in Darpon, a giant robot designed to harness a pilot's Spiritual Energy in the same way a chi-user does.

  **33 PA:** Initial experiments in Aura are begun by the Better World Institute on one of the Braizen Isles.

  **37 PA:** The first armed satellite is launched into space by the Indelan nation Haptarus. Other countries scramble to do the same. Within a decade, space is weaponized.

  **40 PA:** The Indelan nation Haptarus sends a huge fleet of aircraft to invade the nation of Peral and begin a new empire on the fertile continent. It goes swimmingly in the sense that most of the planes end up in the ocean. Otherwise, no, it does not go swimmingly.

  **42 PA:** In response to an increase in Dreamer crime and vigilantism throughout Ilessia, SIDE is founded.

  **50 PA:** On the bi-centennial anniversary of the Assembly's founding, the world's premier Dreamer organization announces the creation of Hero Corps and the Assembly Cleanup Crew, allowing Dreamers who wish to use their powers to help and protect others a means to do so without the difficulties of vigilantism.

  **61 PA:** SIDE, in association with Hero Corps, develops the Threat Level system as a way of prioritizing dangers.

  **67 PA:** The Reclaimers develop their own Threat Level system as a way of categorizing the danger presented by Dreamers to Normal people.

  **68 PA:** A positive repercussion of the weaponizing of space \- a joint effort between Ilessia, Limbra, Kyana, Veneil, Leron, Haptarus, Peral, Dyburen, and Terol (as well as now-defunct Indelan nations Arazeth and Michtor) establishes the Safety Net, a network of defense satellites capable of detecting and destroying incoming meteors and similar threats before they can become a global hazard.

  **69 PA:** In just sixty years, the Seekers of the Dream have become a global religion nearly on par with Deionism and the Arch-Faith.

  **70 PA:** The first Energy Farms are established.

  **72 PA:** Paradisia rises from the ocean, causing devastating tsunamis to coastal cities of Gil, Fasus, Terol, Luren (East more than West), western Ilessia (Verdania in particular suffered terrible flooding) and Limbra, and pretty much aaaalllll along the east coast of Peral. In no doubt entirely unrelated news, the first Pits are discovered in the Braizen Isles. The Better World Institute declares the effort an unqualified success and begins planning their next Big Thing.

  **75 PA:** The first PitTech is developed.

  **76 PA:** The current Emperor of Haptarus incites a military coup that leads to a civil war.

  **78 PA:** The Emperor of Haptarus conquers his home nation and declares it a monarchy.

  **79 PA:** With a population of over a million Dreamers and an established government, Paradisia is officially recognized as a new nation on the world stage, and joins the nations involved in the Safety Net.

  **80 PA:** The first Mutants come about.

  **82 PA:** Matter generation Dreamtech is advanced to the point that it can be used economically. Combined with Energy Farm technology, poverty begins to rapidly dwindle throughout the developed world.

  **84 PA:** The potential of Braizen Radiation has attracted numerous settlers. Several fortified keeps and fortress cities are established. Conflict becomes common in the Braizen Isles.

  **87 PA:** The Nation of Haptarus begins its war of conquest.

  **89 PA:** The Indelan nation Hittorm falls to Haptarus.

  **120 PA:** The Indelan nation Egardia falls to Haptarus.

  **124 PA:** Current year.

  **The Modern Aranthian Calendar**

  The Awakening was a time of great change and social upheaval in ways large and small. The world had already been growing more interconnected for a long time with the advent of first-century pre-Awakening technology in fields of travel and communication, particularly the internet and smartphones. But one of the side effects of the Awakening was extensive discussion about what it meant to be human, and deep examination into the things that both united and divided Aranth's people. While not all such discussions were positive (anti-Dreamer, Dreamer-supremacy, and Dreamer-separationist movements that eventually grew into organizations like the Reclaimers and the Children of Paradise were direct results of some of these debates), it was definitely a time where many people throughout the world began to really see just how minor many of the differences between them were. It was a time of booming global connectedness and interactivity, of extensive sharing and exchanging of cultures, and of frequent and often embarrassing or hilarious misunderstandings caused by a vast swath of differences in things like languages and calendars.

  The relatively cosmopolitan nature of modern Aranth (different lands still have their own cultures, but at this point in history trying to identify someone's homeland by *physical* characteristics is fairly futile) is a direct result of this time period, as are several modern global conveniences such as Aranth's trade tongue and the modern calendar.

  Historical details aside, there's another tidbit about the Aranthian calendar worth noting more from a metagame perspective than a setting perspective \- it's based on adding a bit of additional smoothness to the M\&M Time Measures table. Every shift in increment calculates the next rank up as exactly double the rank below. Now, for seconds to minutes and minutes to hours, that gives us the same values as on Earth. But it means there are a whopping *thirty-two* hours in an Aranthian day, eight days in a week, exactly four weeks in a month, and sixteen months in...1.5 years.

  Allow me to just take a moment to say, smite *you* M\&M ranks and measures table\!

  So that makes one year ten and two-thirds months. We'll get to that.

  **Days:** Thirty-two hour days. On the average though of course varying by season and location, you're generally talking fifteen hours of daylight, fifteen hours of darkness, and an hour each of sunrise and sunset between them. Your typical, say, Ilessian professional's day looks something like this (obviously, this can vary extensively, but your average Joe):

  3:00 dt: Breakfast (usually a bit of a smaller meal) and head to work.  
  4:00 dt: Start work shift.  
  9:00 dt: End work shift, extended break period, might go home if short commute or do stuff in the area around the office.  
  10:00 dt: Lunch during break.  
  11:00 dt: Begin second work shift.  
  16:00 dt: End work shift and head home. Typically the time for household chores, preparing dinner, helping kids with their homework, whatever.  
  2:00 nt: Dinner (usually a larger meal).  
  3:00 nt: Personal time. Go out with friends, spend time with the family, hit a bar or club, catch a movie, watch some shows, read a book, whatever. Worth noting though, another full meal shortly before bedtime not generally being great for you, it's not uncommon for Aranthians to get periodic snacks during this time so they're not hungry just before bed, although the alternative is to just go bigger at dinner. Some more ambitious people (or those who need some extra money) might fit another work shift or a part-time job here. Other more constructive options are energy generation, night classes, and so on.  
  8:00 nt: Start getting ready for bed.  
  9:00 nt: Sleeping.

  \*dt \= "daytime" or "during the day". nt \= "nighttime" or "at night". 1:00 dt usually more-or-less corresponds to the hour of sunrise in most parts of the world. 1:00 nt corresponding to sunset...is more hit-or-miss depending on location and season, but it's fair on average. Military time goes from 0000 to 3159\.  
  **Weeks:** The days of the week were stolen outright from Deionists, who are to groups of eight like SIDE is to acronyms \- they've never met one they didn't like:

  *Dreiday:* The Day of the Drive is the first day of the week. Supposedly, this is when you return to work invigorated from your weekend and ready to put out full effort\! Or it's the Aranthian equivalent to Monday. *One* of those two for sure\!

  *Fetday:* The Day of the Fate. In theory, once you've used Dreiday to build the foundation and get the basic chores and tasks of the workweek done with, this day lets you really *plan* and *prepare* for the major tasks of your work week; figure out what you want to have done by the end of the week, get yourself organized, and begin attacking the issues one by one. Why they suggest you only start planning *after* you've spent a day doing stuff is yet to be determined, but I suppose the Drive waits for no plan.

  *Preimday:* The Day of the Promise. With your energy up and your plan set, you move forward with your life hitting the main goals of the week. It's a nice way to look at what is realistically just a boring day in the middle of the workweek.

  *Naeday:* The Day of the Nature. Realistically, what's the chance everything has gone smoothly so far? In Deionic tradition, this is a day where you resolve any chaos and complications that the week has brought, bringing things back into balance and keeping your plan on track. If you're the type of person whose chaos and complications always wait for a discrete day of the week to hit you, hey, more power to you. The rest of us will have to content ourselves with enjoying the thought.

  *Lurday:* The Day of the Lore. A time for review and assessment as the work week draws towards a close. Did you accomplish your plan? Have your tasks been completed to your satisfaction? What can you still improve on right now, and what can you do better going forward? These are important questions that I'm sure you'll ask yourself if you ever don't spend this day fitfully cramming all the stuff that's still on your desk so you don't have to spend a full day on...

  *Gefday:* The Day of the Gift. And for most businesses, that means *payday*\! Yay\! Deionic tradition for the win\! I have absolutely no complaints here and *neither should you*\! Even better, a decent number of businesses consider this a half day. TAIG for sure. (Yes, that stands for Thank Arch It's Gefday. Just because the days were stolen from Deionism doesn't mean we can't Arch up our slang\!)

  *Heirday:* The Day of the Heart. Weekend, typically means no work or school, awesome. This is the more fun weekend day by Deionic tradition, where people are encouraged to spend time with their loved ones, enjoy their hobbies, and otherwise focus on the stuff they like.

  *Trueday:* The Day of the Truth. A more holy day among Deionists, a time for spiritual reflection, prayer, and active works to do the ultimate job of all Deionists \- adding more Positive energy to the world. For the rest of us, another welcome day off.

  **Months:** There are ten months to an Aranth year, divided into the same four seasons as Earth, although not as evenly (Spring and Autumn, as the more temperate seasons, get the time where weather tends to be shifting, so they're three months long each, while summer and winter are two). Now, that's 320 days. But because of ~~the wonky 1.5 years jump in the M\&M time values table curse yoooouuuu\!\!\!\!~~ the period over which Aranth orbits its sun, an Aranth year has 341.33. Twenty of those extra days are placed *between* months, specifically one at the start of each month, and one at the end (this matters for reasons that will be explained along with what happens to those other 1.33 days). These days are outside of both the months and the weeks, so they get named for different gods. Specifically, you have Dremday at the start of each month, and Arcday at the end. In terms of dates, these are referred to simply as the day name and the month name, so the day before the official start of Inidawn would be simply Dremday of Inidawn. In terms of dates, they replace the numerical day with D or A. So Dremday of Inidawn, 124 PA would be shorthanded as D/1/124.

  Dremday and Arcday always are considered "weekend" days themselves. Many holidays are celebrated between months to allow for more time off, and families often use this time for small vacations like camping trips, visiting relatives, and so on.

  The months themselves are named numerically, with similarities by season. Of note, the Aranth year is considered to begin with Spring:

  *Spring Months:* Inidawn, Secundawn, Thrissdawn.

  *Summer Months:* Quadril, Quindril.

  *Autumn Months:* Sesseven, Septeven, Octeven.

  *Winter Months:* Nonender, Decender.

  **Years:** An Aranth year is 341.33 days. We've got 340 between ten thirty-two day months with two bonus days each. The last whole day is slotted in as New Year's Day (occasionally just called Yearday, shorthanded as Y/0/124), set between Arcday of Decender and Dreamday of Inidawn. Five day weekends *for the win*, is all I'm saying. Upping to *six days* every three years as the fractional days get leap year'd in as Leap Year Day (alternately, Nonday, shorthanded N/0/124). And look, I'm not saying that just because it's called "Nonday" literally means it's not a day and as far as celebrating Aranthians are concerned it and more importantly everything that happens during it *doesn't count*. I'm also not saying that particular excuse doesn't get occasionally brought up to angry boyfriends, girlfriends, spouses, bosses, neighbors...ahem. Anyway.

  **Major Holidays:**

  *Archmas \[Arcday of Nonender\]:* Is it too obvious to say it's Aranth's equivalent to Christmas? Because it's totally Aranth's equivalent to Christmas. With all the commercialism that entails. That being said, it's *also* and *primarily* (if only just) a celebration of the Revelation. The story goes that on this day, Arch made his first and only direct contact with the people of Aranth, sending visions in extremely vivid, lucid dreams to his first prophets. The visions, while crystal-clear and burned into their memories, were nonetheless *vague*, images of worlds and stars being created, of the prophets' own souls being given the choice of which world they would like to live on from an entity that could not be described in words, and choosing Aranth. The dream ended with a divine voice saying into their heads in words like holy fire, "I am Arch. And I Exist." Since then, Archmas has been the highest of holy days of the Church of Arch, a day of contemplation and prayer, of thanks to Arch for not just creating us and our world, but for offering us the choice to live here. It is also a day of thanks for and to one's loved ones, for choosing this world and in doing so being a part of each other's lives.

  Gift-giving is common on Archmas, both as an expression of thanks for one's loved ones and symbolically of the gifts that Arch gave to people \- the knowledge of where they came from, the world they live on, and the choice to live there.

  And oh, let me be clear, there is totally a Santa Claus equivalent on Aranth. Although on Aranth he's more-or-less real, at least as of recent. Look, say what you want about Big Dreams, Inc. But every Archmas they get together some of their best speedsters, flyers, and teleporters, put together huge parcels of toys, negotiate some border passes with various governments, and send folks *off* to deliver them to the homes of as many of the world's children as they can manage, and they manage a darn substantial percentage of them. And they do it all for free (people \- or adults anyway \- widely know it's them now, but they did actually keep it as secret as possible for the first few years, and they still don't actively advertise it). And if that's not an Archmas miracle, I don't know what is.

  (...Haptarus refuses to lower their border defense weaponry and the first and only time they tried it with Haptarus they lost half a dozen powerful transport dreamers. I cannot think of any way to make clearer how much Haptarus' evil knows no bounds.)

  *The Feast of the Gods \[8th of Octeven (Trueday) to 15th of Octeven (Heirday)\]:* The highest of Deionist holidays \- holi*weeks* more precisely \- is the Feast of the Gods, an eight-day celebration beginning on the eighth day of the eighth month because seriously it's Haptarus with evil, then SIDE with acronyms, and then Deionists with the number eight. This eight-day event celebrates the beginnings of the Church of Deionism, where people from all over the world traveled to what would eventually become the site of the Gathering Home, and where over the course of eight days of feasting and sharing stories, the first eight to arrive were given knowledge of the gods and their works through a series of vivid, lucid dreams.

  The Feast of the Gods is not typically an intimate celebration with close friends and family, though. It's a time for big parties, community gatherings, and so on. Many people spend the Feast travelling to other cities or even countries, joining in the festivities in whatever lands they roam to. Above all, the Feast of the Gods celebrates a time when people from all over the world gathered to celebrate the divine \- it's a time for meeting new people, seeing new things, and forging new friendships. And overeating. Definitely a lot of overeating going on too.

  *The Festival of Life \[32nd of Inidawn (Trueday) to 1st of Secundawn (Dreiday)\]:* Originally celebrated mainly in Dymara, in the aftermath of the Awakening and the boom of global interconnectedness, the Festival of Life began spreading to other countries. Because honestly whether you believe in the Way or not, it's a kinda nice thing to celebrate and who doesn't like more holidays, right? A four-day festival in early-mid spring, the Festival emphasizes games, sports, and communal entertainments. Displays of skill and prowess are frequent parts of the festivities, as people show off their skills for the entertainment of others.

  The Festival celebrates *life* as a whole and the interconnectedness of all people. Outside of Dymara, this is essentially sufficient. Traditionally, though, it's also a remembrance of the days the Way was revealed to the people of Dymara. Each night over the course of these four days, a different Chi master in a different Dymaran kingdom had a vicid, lucid Dream about the life of one of the others, so detailed and clear that it was as if they had lived it. The four strangers who no longer were sought each other out, sharing their experience and went on to share their revelation of the interconnectedness of life throughout the Dymaran kingdoms. And thus was the Way born.

  *The Homage \[13th of Quadril (Lurday)\]:* In Peral, the Homage is a grand celebration of those who came before \- of one's ancestors, of great figures of history, and of the Legends of myth and the Legacies they left behind. It's a day of feasting and drinking, stories and song, thousands of tales being told and retold throughout Peral. It's a reflection of the first day the spirits came to their descendents, with scores of people throughout Peral experiencing vivid, lucid dreams where their ancestors spoke to them, told them their stories, and asked to be remembered. The Keeping of Legend and Legacy has remained an important part of Perallan culture to this day.

  Since the Awakening, the Homage has spread to other nations as a day to reflect on where they came from and celebrate the great people and deeds of the past \- or the present, for it is never too early for new legends to begin\! Fun fact, the Homage is *also* kinda Aranth Halloween. Adults go to costume parties where they dress up as famous, fictional, or historical figures, while kids put on costumes and go "visiting", going door to door to basically show off their costumes, and people give them candies or little trinkets. It's traditional to give out something to every kid who comes to the door, but to also have a few special gifts reserved for giving to kids dressed as people you feel are significant to you personally (such as an historical figure you look up to, a fictional character you enjoyed growing up, or so on, since this is a sort of symbolic gesture of thanks to the people they're dressed *as*. In Ilessia (and somewhat abroad, though certainly less so), Heroes are (as one would probably expect) *extremely* popular subjects for kids' Homage costumes.

  *The Day of Awakening \[Dremday of Thrissdawn\]:* Dremday of Thrissdawn is remembered as the Day of the Awakening, when a small group of Dreamers officially revealed themselves to the world and changed the face of Aranth forever. For most of the world, it serves as more a remembrance than an actual celebration. It *is* considered the top holiday of the Seekers of the Dream though, so there are various church-related events for devotees of that faith. It's also a *very* big deal in Paradisia (Paradisia itself was raised on the Day of Awakening, for the symbolism), with huge celebrations and displays of powers not dissimilar to the feats of skill that you tend to see in the Festival of Life. Since it's at the start of a new month (four day weekends yo\!) a lot of Dreamers choose to visit Paradisia on Heirday of Secundur, spend the weekend, celebrate the Day of Awakening there, and then return home the next morning (with assistance from Dreamers with long-range or high-speed transport powers as necessary). Although there's always a few who decide not to go back.

  *The Foundings \[Varies\]:* The Foundings are eight major Deionist holidays, each one celebrating one of the Gods on the day of the founding of their High Temples. Spending each Founding at the High Temple of the appropriate god is part of the traditional Deionic pilgrimage. The Foundings are typically only celebrated by Deionists, but that still means they're celebrated by a fair number of people world-wide. Celebration usually involves acts that are positive for the relevant god, so like the Founding of Heart involves more outright celebration and positive emotion, having fun and spending time with loved ones, the Founding of Drive is a day to work on pet projects and such, and so on. Worth noting, the Founding of Gift does involve gift-giving and winds up not dissimilar to Archmas (Aranth Santa Claus is a secular invention and applies to both), and being just before the same weekend as Archmas, that whole weekend is usually the Aranth equivalent of Christmas break. The days of the individual Foundings are:  
  The Founding of Gift: 30th of Nonender.  
  The Founding of Nature: 12th of Inidawn.  
  The Founding of Heart: 23rd of Secundawn.  
  The Founding of Drive: 17th of Thrissdawn.  
  The Founding of Promise: 19th of Quadril.  
  The Founding of Lore: 5th of Quindril.  
  The Founding of Fate: 10th of Sesseven.  
  The Founding of Truth: 16th of Septeven.

  *Victory Day \[25th of Quindril (Dreiday)\]:* Ilessia celebrates Victory Day as the day that Ilessia came together in its modern form. It's called Victory Day because at that point there were two major countries remaining in northern Aldonis \- Ilessia and Havaren \- which had been warring for the past twelve years for control of the northern half of the continent, a conflict which ended in victory for Ilessia. Victory Day is typically celebrated with fireworks, parades both civilian and military, and other displays of power and patriotism. Political candidates often announce their campaigns on Victory Day. It's also a usually-pleasant late summer day capping off a three-day weekend, so beach trips, camping trips, cookouts, barbecues, and the like tend to be common.

  *Unity Day \[11th of Septeven (Preimday)\]:* Unity Day is Limbra's equivalent of Victory Day, celebrating the country coming together in its current form. This wasn't the result of a war, but a series of political alliances between the three remaining nations in southern Aldonis (due largely, in fact, to the concern that Ilessian forces were by that point well recovered from their previous wars and the newly-unified nation might well plan to expand its conquest further, which none of the three could counter individually). Unity Day tends to be more reserved than Ilessia's Victory Day, but some of the country's biggest sporting events usually go on throughout the day, and Unity Day is a common day to propose or plan weddings (or other unions, for that matter, such as announcing business mergers).

  *The Fourth of Quadril \[Naeday\]:* Both Limbra and Ilessia celebrate the Fourth of Quadril as the day the two countries signed the Treaty of Aldonis that ended hostilities between them and forged a strong alliance that has stood even to this day. The end of the regular conflicts between them and the increase in trade and sharing of knowledge is a large part of what led these two from being merely fairly large countries to the out-and-out military and economic superpowers they are today. The Fourth of Quadril has a more outright celebratory air than either Victory or Unity day, but is puntuated by strains of the friendly rivalry the two nations share as both seek to outdo each other with their fun. That said, it's also a common time for people to travel between the two allied nations and visit the neighboring country. The highlight of the day, of course, is the Grand Rumble \- a ten-on-ten competitive brawl in the twenty-mile no-man's-land that serves as the border between the two nations. With the competitors being the finest mecha pilots either army can field\! Both nations are *fiercely* proud of their previous Rumble victories (the current record stands at 23:19 in Ilessia's favor, although Limbra's won the past two years running). Most other nations of the world find the Grand Rumble to be *objectively* ludicrous, using top-tier military weaponry as some sort of sport of all things\! ...But that doesn't stop people throughout the world from tuning in to the live broadcasts, because objectively ludicrous or not it is an *epic* show\!

  *The Queen's Fair \[32nd of Sesseven (Trueday) to 1st of Septeven (Dreiday)\]:* The Queen's Fair is celebrated in Dymara, memorializing Queen Dymara's quest to unite the continent through personal combat rather than a bloody and destructive war. Throughout the Four Kingdoms, huge fairgrounds are set up in the lands around each of the royal castles, offering food, drink, music, dancing, fireworks, and various contests of skill and tournaments. Large-scale martial arts tournaments are of course a big part of the festivities, and the top contenders in each country go on to compete for the title of Champion of the Fair. Officially, members of the Royal Families are prohibited from competing...buuuut it's an open secret that there's usually at least one prince or princess in each country who enters the tournaments in disguise, and they tend to be the contenders to beat for the honor of moving onto the final round.

  *The Feasts of the Seasons \[Varies\]:* Originally a series of Perallan holidays, they're now fairly-widely celebrated throughout the world. Celebrating the seasons, traditionally, the Feasts took place roughly when the seasons changed, but the exact days weren't really set and tended to vary between regions. In modern times, the Feast of Summer takes place on Arcday of Trissdawn and Dremday of Quadril, the Feast of Autumn takes place on Arcday of Quindril and Dremday of Sesseven, and the Feast of Winter takes place on Arcday of Octeven and Dremday of Nonender. The Feast of Spring...well, it breaks the pattern with a purpose, taking place on the 1st and 2nd of Inidawn. The Feasts are pretty much just that, days where people gather together for huge feasts filled with stories and song. Nobody wants or needs it to get more complicated than that.

  *The Crossing \[29th of Decender (Lurday) to 30th of Decender (Gefday)\]:* Originally an Indelan holiday, it spread to the rest of the world after the Awakening. In Indelar, conflict-heavy as the continent has always been, the Crossing was a time for peace and friendship. Or at least respect where friendship wasn't presently possible. Among nations who weren't at war, it was an opportunity to travel and experience neighboring cultures. Even among those who were at war, combat took a pause during the Crossing, allowing both sides a chance to tend to their wounded, bury their dead, and so on. Prisoner exchanges were often held during the Crossing, and traditionally, it was meant for the conflicting nations to have a chance to really consider whether their war was worth fighting, especially if this was a war that had seen more than one Crossing. Admittedly, that rarely actually worked out, but it wasn't uncommon for treaties or armistice to be officially signed during the Crossing.

  If you think Haptarus respects or even so much as acknowledges even the tiniest sense of the traditions of the Crossing, you have not been paying any attention at all. While the Free Nations of Indelar cannot afford to pause their war efforts for this or any holiday, they do still celebrate it among themselves as best circumstance allows.

  In a more modern and global sense, the Crossing is largely a celebration of the themes brought about during the Awakening of interconnectedness and cultural exchange. So, another travel holiday, basically. Aranth likes those.

  *New Year's Celebration \[New Years Day and...then some\]:* So, you know, New Years Day. Not too much different from Earth. Everyone celebrates it in a manner best suiting their cultural traditions. Countdowns are common. *But*, if you've been paying attention, you might have noticed something.

  29th and 30th Decender \- The Crossing. 31st and 32nd Decender \- Heirday and Trueday, i.e. weekend. Arcday of Decender \- Arcday, i.e. more weekend. New Year Day \- holiday in itself. Dremday of Inidawn \- Dremday, i.e. more weekend. 1st and 2nd of Inidawn \- The Feast of Spring. So for nine days as the years change (ten days on leap years\!) it's basically constant holidays and weekends. *This*, friends, is how Aranth celebrates New Years. Have fun\!

  A role playing game is three things. It is an interactive story, a game of chance, and a process in critical thinking.

  **Playing in Aranth**

* **Spoiler: Assumed House Rules**  
* Hide  
  In my games, I've fairly-well settled on certain house rules that largely apply to character creation. I assume these house rules in the mechanics below, so some tweaking may be required for games that don't use them.

  **Ability Rebalancing**

  **Strength:** You can lift a Mass Rank equal to your Strength Rank. Your basic physical attacks have a Damage rank equal to your Strength rank.

  Additionally, all Affliction, Damage, Move Object, and Weaken powers you possess can be designated as "Strength Discounted". Each rank of Strength reduces the PP cost of such powers by 1\. However, in any given round, you may only use one Strength Discounted power at a time, so if you want to Link multiple attacks or have some use lower action types, only one may be Strength Discounted. Strength Discounted powers cost a minimum of 1 PP each. This applies to *all* such powers; they don't have to have anything to do with Strength. This is an "I already paid for that" discount, not a realism discount.

  ("Strength Discounted" and "Strength-based" are two sides of the same coin. You can't use both simultaneously, but if you want to write out a power as Strength-based because your Strength actually adds directly to it, feel free).

  **Stamina:** Each rank of Stamina provides \+1 Toughness and \+1 Fortitude.

  **Agility:** Each rank of Agility provides \+1 to your Ranged Attack bonus, \+1 Dodge, \+1 Mobility, and \+2 Initiative.

  **Dexterity:** Each rank of Dexterity provides \+1 to your Melee Attack bonus, \+1 Parry, \+1 Stealth, and \+2 Initiative.

  **Fighting:** Each rank of Fighting provides \+1 to your Melee Attack bonus, Ranged Attack bonus, Dodge, and Parry. Note that while these bonuses do stack with Agility and Dexterity, they are still capped at your PL limit.

  **Intellect:** Each rank of Intellect provides \+1 Expertise, Investigation, Technology, and Treatment.

  **Awareness:** Each rank of Awareness provides \+1 Will, \+1 Insight, and \+1 Perception.

  **Presence:** Each rank of Presence provides \+1 Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion, and also provides one bonus skill point which may be spent only on Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, Insight, or Expertise.

  **Combat Stats**

  **Attack Bonus:** Attack Bonus in general is considered to be worth 1 PP/rank, with Melee or Ranged being 1 PP per 2 ranks, which is accounted for in the bonuses you get from Abilities. The Close and Ranged Combat Advantages thus provide \+2 to attack bonus with the relevant attack mode rather than \+1, and the skills have been removed. The Accurate Extra still works normally. If you want a character who is only skilled with certain weapons, treat it as a Complication.

  **Defense:** Dodge and Parry are worth 1 PP per 2 ranks, so Defense in general comes out to 1 PP per rank. This is reflected in the Abilities, and also applies when purchasing Dodge and Parry directly or as Enhanced Traits. For purposes of Weakens, Dodge and Parry are considered a single stat (so each point of failure lowers *both* by only a *single* point). In essence, there is one Defense stat, and Dodge is "Defense Limited to Ranged Attacks" while Parry is "Defense Limited to Close Attacks".

  **Skill Changes**

  **Combat Skills:** Remove Close Combat and Ranged Combat skills entirely.

  **Expertise:** If you purchase ranks of Expertise directly (rather than through Intellect), you may apply those ranks to up to one field of Expertise per rank of Expertise purchased. You may also divide one set of ranks among multiple Expertise fields, so long as no single field exceeds your total ranks. For example, if you have Expertise 10, you could take Dreamer Lore \+10, Popular Culture \+5, Current Events \+5, as two of your allowed ten fields. Your Intellect bonus then applies to all fields of Expertise you are trained in (so if that character had Int 5, its final values would be Dreamer Lore \+15, Popular Culture \+10, Current Events \+10). You may also spend one Expertise field to learn a new language or gain 1 EP. You can buy more Expertise fields at the rate of five fields per PP. The Languages advantage is removed as this option is strictly better.

  If you don't want that many fields, as long as you have at least four ranks of Expertise, you can take Quirk 1 to halve the number of fields you get. As long as you have at least eight ranks, you can take Quirk 2 to only get one field.

  **Mobility:** Combine Acrobatics, Athletics, and Vehicles into one skill, Mobility. Mobility also gains the Escape and Contortion options from Sleight of Hand. A Mobility check to increase speed can boost any movement mode, not just land speed, and beating the DC by multiple degrees can generally let you cross some spare distance above your normal movement but below the next Distance Rank, if you need to. Mobility is straight Agility-based even though it also absorbs some Strength and Dexterity based skills.

  However, in any circumstance where you would normally be given the option of rolling either an Athletics or Acrobatics check (such as to escape a Grab or resist a Trip), you may substitute your Strength for your Agility on the Mobility check, if doing so would be advantageous to you.

  **Stealth:** Stealth gains all other functions of Sleight of Hand, which is removed.

  **Treatment:** In addition to its other capabilities, as a standard action, you can use Treatment to assist a character suffering from an Affliction. A successful Treatment check (DC 15 \+ Affliction rank) reduces the degree of the Affliction by one per degree of success. You can only treat a given Affliction once. Treatment can also be substituted for Expertise (Medicine).

  **Alternate Resistances**

  Alternate Resistance Toughness, Fortitude, and Will are always worth \+0 *except* when applied to powers created "on the fly" as with a Power Stunt or Variable power, in which case they're worth \+1 as it's assumed you're targeting a weakness.

  I generally don't use Alternate Resistance (Dodge) or (Parry) because they're frankly overpowered. I have three alternatives that I use instead, so when you see these below, this is what they mean:

  **Highest Active Defense:** The higher of Dodge, Parry, Defensive Roll, or Deflect. A character who is actively defending gets the usual \+10 on rolls of 10 or less. This option is slightly more balanced (and more realistic) than straight Dodge or Parry by letting more stats get in on the act and allowing active defense to improve the result, although it doesn't fix the glaring balance issue that active defense stats are way easier to reduce than normal resistance checks. Costs \+1/rank.

  **Prowess:** Functions as Highest Active Defense, but also allows Strength (and similar effects such as Move Object) or your highest speed-based power rank (Speed, Leaping, Flight, Teleportation, etc). Costs \+0/rank \- if the enemy can't pull together a basic level-appropriate defense with all these options, that's their problem.

  **Highest Base Active Defense:** Functions as Highest Active Defense, but doesn't include Deflect and doesn't include *any* external modifiers that apply to active defense stats specifically, including the Defend action bonus, Vulnerable, Defenseless, All Out Attack, or Defensive Attack. The most balanced option (though admittedly, somewhat less realistic than straight Highest Active Defense), it does have its advantages in terms of enemies not being able to supercharge their resistance check through Defending or Defensive Attacking, but it also means they can't be easily crippled with Vulnerable, Defenseless, or All Out Attack. Modifiers that apply to the stats directly (such as Weakens and Enhanced Traits) or to checks in general (such as Impaired, Disabled, and Inspire) still apply as normal. Costs \+1/rank; even with the glaring balance issue fixed, active defense is directly opposed to Toughness, and even with the costs evened out, resistance is generally favorable to defense. Toughness shifting is generally favorable, so this still carries a surcharge.

  **Other Little "Abbreviations"**

  **Targeted Area:** Basically a Feature/Quirk added to an Area effect that causes it to require an attack roll instead of allowing a save for half. Good because it lets you do stuff like crit, Multiattack, Accurate/All Out/Defensive/Power Attack, etc. Bad because it means you can miss, you have to have attack bonus, you're subject to Interpose and Deflect and such, etc.

  **Quirk (Heal Order):** A Quirk added to Healing powers that makes them heal Dying \-\> Bruises \-\> Staggered \-\> Incapacitated rather than the normal Dying \-\> Incapacitated \-\> Staggered \-\> Bruises. Usually paired with Limited to One Degree for Linked or Area Healing effects, or Quirk 3 (two degrees to heal Staggered, three to heal Incapacitated) for individual targeted ones, to make Healing actually adequately balanced.

  **Superheroes in the World of Aranth**

  **Costumes and Codenames:** Use of costumes and codenames varies widely. A lot of the normal reasons for having a secret identity can be dealt with in this setting with minimal effort (register your powers, join a group like Hero Corps or the Champions Guild, etc). That said, plenty of Dreamers who want to use their powers to help others also want to keep their personal lives out of the public eye and have time for themselves. Likewise, there are a lot of Dreamers who do use costumes and codenames without having a secret identity at all \- their heroic identity is their brand, and they promote it like any business entity. Some just do it for the style factor. The media, especially in Ilessia, tends to love "super identities"; chances are if you don't pick your own, they will pick at least a codename for you as soon as you spend a few minutes in the spotlight.

  On the flip side, a lot of Dreamers, especially those working in law enforcement, the military, or other more structured organizations, see these things as gimmicky and outdated (back in the day, the argument was that they were gimmicky and childish, making actual heroes look like they jumped out of kid shows and comic books). Likewise, plenty of Dreamers want to be known for who they are, they don't want people to know them as some person in a mask. A lot of Dreamers really like the feeling of being able to walk down the street or head to the grocery store and see people pointing and waving, or run up for autographs or whatever. In the entertainment industry, branding too heavily into a costumed identity makes it hard to get recognition as a legitimate actor; you're typecasting yourself right off the bat.

  So there's actually a pretty big debate in the Dreamer community about them, which can get fairly heated. Members of Hero Corps, in particular, have some very strong opinions on both sides and will give fellow Heroes endless grief if they make the "wrong" choice.

  **Powers in Play:** It is also important to note that Dreamer powers (and other power origins) are not entirely limitless. In *general play*, powers are still usable at will. However, most non-personal powers do have some limits, and repeated use of high frequency or intensity can drain a Dreamer's deeper reserves of energy, which takes a long time to recover. Thus, a healer, for example, could certainly make a living as a doctor, and could easily keep up with the party's injuries accrued in normal play, but it couldn't hope to be constantly healing large numbers of people day after day, or cure an epidemic single-handedly. A teleporter, likewise, couldn't just invalidate normal trade routes, although every so often, it could transport massive volumes. Most Dreamers who do use their powers commercially, thus, charge appropriately, both to earn a good living and ensure they don't push themselves too hard. Generally speaking, this shouldn't come up in normal play (for standard heroing, powers are still basically at-will unless explicitly limited), but it's the explanation for why society can resemble the modern world at all (although to be fair, there are quite a few differences).

  **Aranth Expertise**

  While all the usual Expertise skills are available in Aranth, the setting also has some more specific Expertise skills. Some Expertise skills in Aranth are considered *specialized*. These skills are *not* considered trained due to Jack of All Trades, Eidetic Memory, or similar; you must spend actual fields of expertise on them. If the game is held in a location indicated as common for the skill, or the character comes from such a place, the skill is not considered specialized.

  **Expertise (Braizen Radiation) \[Specialized\]:** Covers scientific theory and principles regarding Braizen radiation, including mutants, PitTech, and the Pits themselves. It can also be used to recall information about specific noteworthy mutants or PitTech scientists. Note that Braizen Radiation is a relatively new phenomenon and the study of it is in its relative infancy, so the information gained from this skill may occasionally be incomplete. A character's Technology skill is capped by its Expertise (Braizen Radiation) skill when dealing with PitTech. This Expertise is very rare outside of the Braizen Isles.

  **Expertise (Chi) \[Specialized\]:** Covers the Dymaran practice of Chi, controlling the flows of Spiritual Energy through the body. Can be used to identify Chi techniques, gain information about noteworthy Chi practitioners, and know general information and theory related to Chi. It can also be used to refine information gained through Chi senses (analytical ones especially), and may be used when performing certain precise or technical Chi applications (as opposed to those involving raw power or strength of spirit), especially when opposing another Chi user. This Expertise is very rare outside of Dymara.

  **Expertise (Dreamer Lore):** Covers general information about Dreamers and Dreamer powers. A Dreamer may substitute Expertise (Dreamer Lore) for Expertise (Law) for purposes to recalling legal information regarding the use of its own powers. This skill can also be used to identify Dreamer powers you see used or extrapolate other potential capabilities of Dreamers whose powers you see in action. It may be used to recall information about specific noteworthy Dreamers.

  **Expertise (Local):** Covers general knowledge about whatever city is central to the game or that the character lives in.

  **Expertise (Magic) \[Specialized\]:** Covers information about magic, magical items, and specific noteworthy magic-using individuals. This skill can be used to identify magical powers you see used, although extrapolating the powers of a given mage tends to be futile.

  **Expertise (Myth and Legend) \[Specialized\]:** Covers information about ancient mythological figures and stories. This skill doesn't reveal historical fact, only mythic tales, so it should be taken with a grain of salt. That being said, many are the myths that contain a kernel of truth that has been buried in the dross of mere history. This skill is most common in Peral, and somewhat common in Dymara, but very rare elsewhere.

  **Expertise (Null Lore) \[Specialized\]:** Covers information about Nulls as they differ from regular Dreamers. This is particularly in regards to their revenance, identifying certain "types" of "undead" and what their capabilities may be, as well as recalling information about specific notable Nulls. This skill is very rare outside of Indelar.

  **Expertise (Specific Locations) \[Specialized\]:** Covers fairly specific information about the location. The narrower the skill, the more detailed but also the more specific the information. Expertise (Ilessia) would be good for general knowledge of Ilessia and its culture, but you'd only get the most basic overview of say the five regions of Ilessia. Expertise (Adaros) would be good for detailed information of Adaros and the outlying region, but only give information on Ilessia itself as it relates specifically to Adaros, and wouldn't give more than cursory information about any specific city in the region (save the city of Adaros itself).

  **Expertise (Specific Organizations) \[Specialized\]:** Covers the general skillset appropriate to the chosen organization. Expertise (SIDE) would involve knowledge of Dreamer-related law, tactics, SIDE protocols, etc. Expertise (IDEA) would cover general scientific knowledge particularly as related to Dreamers, current major IDEA projects, etc. And so on.

  **Expertise (Spiritual Energy):** Covers knowledge of Spiritual Energy, its functions, uses, and so on. This includes a solid understanding of the mechanics *behind* Spiritual Energy fueled powers, such as Dreamer powers, Chi, and magic. It won't give much information about the powers themselves or their users, but will offer a good understanding of how they work more "behind the scenes".

  **Expertise (The Matrix) \[Specialized\]:** Covers knowledge of Limbra's Matrix. While the Technology skill is still used to interact with the Matrix, this skill lets you identify Matrix operations, helps use the Matrix more efficiently for operating a system, helps you figure out the capabilities of Avatars and Keepers, and lets you identify specific notable Matrix users. This skill is very rare outside of Limbra.

  **Expertise (World Culture):** Covers a very broad overview of the different cultures of the world. Good for getting the gist about a country overall, things like cultural norms, values, etc. Knowing if something would be taken as an insult or against the law and such. This skill won't really help with more specific information regarding people and places within each country. In short, a good skill for tourists, not so great for spies.

  **PL 16+:** A "world-class" Dreamer or Null.

  **Threat Levels:** SIDE and Hero Corps use Threat Levels as a broad method of ranking the priority of crimes, hazards, and such. Higher Threat Levels entail greater risk to more people. Threat Levels are fairly commonly referenced in the news as well.

* **Spoiler**  
* Hide  
  Threat Level 1: Small-scale, non-violent crimes, or minor things of the "cat caught up a tree" variety.

  Threat Level 2: Most crimes that are harmful to a single person, but either non-violent or not lethal \- thefts, drunken brawls, etc.

  Threat Level 3: Situations that entail a small risk of loss of life, serious property damage, or substantial physical, mental, or emotional trauma, with sufficient emergency personnel either en route or already on the scene. Armed robbery, fires, domestic abuse, grand theft, etc.

  Threat Level 4: As Threat Level 3, but sufficient emergency personnel is not on scene and not expected to be arriving in the next few minutes.

  Threat Level 5: Situations that entail high risk of above concerns, or low to moderate risk to multiple people, again with sufficient emergency personnel either en route or on the scene. Bank robberies, hostage situations, kidnappings, rape, murder, aggravated assault, hit and run, hate crimes, major fires, low-end uncontrolled Dreamer powers or direct Dreamer attacks (typically PL 7 or below), etc.

  Threat Level 6: As Threat Level 5, but again, emergency personnel not on scene, or as Threat Level 7 but with emergency personnel on scene.

  Threat Level 7: Serious risk of major loss of life or extensive property damage, with no emergency personnel on scene. Terrorist attacks, significant uncontrolled or intentionally harmful Dreamer powers (typically PL 8-12), small-scale disasters.

  Threat Level 8: A community, neighborhood, or some large group is at risk; Threat Levels of 8 or above retain their designation regardless of emergency personnel on scene. Multiple powerful Dreamers, small-scale military operations, mid-scale disasters, giant rampaging monsters, etc.

  Threat Level 9: Entire city at risk.

  Threat Level 10: Entire region at risk.

  Threat Level 11 (theoretical): Entire country at risk.

  Threat Level 12 (theoretical): Entire world at risk.

  In addition, the Threat Level is also used as a quick-and-dirty way to measure the power of Dreamers. This methodology was popularized by the Reclaimers, and was something of a media masterstroke. Sociologically, having people calling Dreamers "threats" whenever discussing their power is a significant win for the Reclaimers. Likewise, even though the two scales are unrelated, it's pretty natural for people to link them up. Psychologically, knowing a Dreamer is Threat Level 5 creates the impression that it is as dangerous as such things as major house fires, murders, hostage situations, and so on.

  Dreamer Threat Levels don't necessarily correspond to Situational Threat Levels, since the systems were devised by two different organizations. The descriptors for the Dreamer Threat Levels are not part of the original Reclaimer system, but have kinda worked their way into it over time. Dreamer Threat Levels are rated as follows:

* **Spoiler**  
* Hide  
  **Threat Level 1 \- Trivial Powers:** Trivial powers are the weakest of the weak, abilities that honestly don't have much value at all. In most cases, Dreamers of this level have only a single Feature worth of Dreamer Powers, or maybe some other weak effect like \+1 or \+2 to a skill, an Enhanced Advantage, or stuff like that. Their powers are rarely worth more than one point, and some one-point powers might even be too strong to count\! (Something like Speed 1 or Quickness 1, for example, would rate at Minor Talent, because being twice as fast as the average person, while not much on the M\&M scale, is still non-trivial).

  **Threat Level 2 \- Minor Talents:** Minor talents are where the majority of Dreamers lie. Typically rated at 5 PP or less, they aren't amazing, but can be very useful in their niche. Most of the powers in the Dreamer Civilian template would qualify as Minor Talents. Some weak, harmless attack powers (Afflictions, often) can still be qualified as Minor Talents, as might things like Strength boosts low enough that they're still in the normal human range. Even the weakest of outright direct-damage powers though (like the Civilian Energy Controller's Ranged Damage 2\) gets moved into the Harmful Powers category.

  **Threat Level 3 \- Job Stealers:** This level applies for Dreamers who don't have any real combat ability, but do have significant powers that can allow them to, at the very least, do a job better than pretty much any normal person, or possibly better than *multiple* normal people. At the low end, Job Stealer Dreamers are pretty much always going to get selected over an equally (or more) otherwise-qualified Normal, because no amount of skill or experience can match their power. At the high end, a single Dreamer can replace an entire workforce. Quickness is probably the single best example of this sort of power, but lots of powers can qualify in the right niches. Even highly skilled jobs can be subject to this \- what surgeon can really compete with a healer? Or how many IT specialists can actually do the job as well as a technopath?

  **Threat Level 4 \- Harmful Powers:** Dreamers with powers that can hurt others. "Hurt" is pretty broadly specified. Mind Reading generally fits in here, for example, because you can steal secrets and use them to cause extreme social harm. Morph ranks of 2 or higher can fit as well for the duplicity purposes. And so on. But mostly we're talking about direct offensive powers, though typically of rank 6 or less and without Area or other boosts allowing the powers to cause harm on a large scale.

  **Threat Level 5 \- Combat-Capable:** A Dreamer with the full package \- a means to harm others, and a means to defend themselves from most forms of harm, at least that regular people can bring to bear. Combat-capable Dreamers are typically PL 5+ (although PL 4 or maybe even 3 can qualify if their powers are especially effective) and have more-or-less PL-appropriate stats across the board. These are Dreamers that can probably come out on top against a typical law enforcement officer, and might be able to take on a fully-armed soldier in single combat, with a bit of luck.

  **Threat Level 6 \- Weapons-Grade:** A Dreamer with harmful powers up there with serious weaponry. The typical weapons-grade Dreamer is PL 8-9, has offensive powers equivalent to professional-grade weapons, and usually has PL-appropriate defenses as well, although less-defended Dreamers who still have high-powered offenses can easily fit here. Offensive Area powers \- Damage in particular \- usually winds up here regardless of other considerations unless the rank is especially low. A weapons-grade Dreamer can casually take down your average soldier, is the safe bet against a SIDE agent, and can usually go toe-to-toe with lighter or older suits of powered armor and have a good shot at winning a straight fight. Only about 1% of Dreamers qualify as weapons-grade or higher Threats.

  **Threat Level 7 \- Hero-Level:** Although this isn't a minimum requirement for Hero Corps, this is pretty much the *average* power of Hero Corps members. PL 10, professional-grade offensive powers, PL-appropriate defenses, a solid-to-high-end mobility power, and probably another trick or two to boot. Hero-level Dreamers are *serious* combatants. Individual soldiers, even special forces operatives, can't hold a candle to them, and the more powerful examples can mow down entire units in seconds. Even an OUT-SIDE agent would struggle to defeat most Hero-level Dreamers in a straight fight. To really have a shot at taking one of these guys one on one, you're talking full suits of modern powered armor, or serious military vehicles.

  **Threat Level 8 \- Military Class:** Military class Dreamers are as powerful as high-end military vehicles, full-scale artillery-emplacements, and sometimes even small-scale mecha. PL 9 or less need not apply, and PL 12 is the average. Military class Dreamers don't necessary possess military-grade weapons powers, but they might, especially if they have actual military training in the use of their powers. Even if they're a bit lacking in the offense department, they make up for it with high mobility and specialized capabilities that big vehicles with big guns just can't match.

  **Threat Level 9 \- Nation Class:** Most of the most powerful Dreamers in a given country will generally be PL 13-15, often with higher-than-average PP for their PL (few Dreamers actually truly push past PL 12, instead just adding additional levels of PP to broaden and refine their powers). This is an extremely rare level of strength for Aranth; generally less than 1% of weapons-grade or higher Dreamers hit this level. Many Dreamers of this level keep their true strength largely hidden; this much power simply isn't needed for most of them to achieve their goals, and flaunting it can bring challengers or complications to their door. But when they are forced to reveal what they are truly capable of...well, just hope you have an entire unit of power-armored soldiers, an equally-powerful Dreamer, or maybe a mech or aircraft carrier on hand to oppose them.

  **Threat Level 10 \- World Class:** The strongest Dreamers (and Nulls \- *in theory*; there actually hasn't been a confirmed case of a Null this strong) on the planet are PL 16+. They are the *only things on Aranth* with an individual PL that high in the modern day \- everything else, even superweapons, stick to the PL 13-15 range and just represent higher levels of power in that area with more PP. A PL 16+ Dreamer will already have at least \+60 PP from their base total, and may have more than that. The hard cap for actual individual PL on Aranth in the modern day is...somewhere between 16 and 18\. But probably 16\. Maybe.

  A role playing game is three things. It is an interactive story, a game of chance, and a process in critical thinking.

  **Descriptors**

  **Spiritual Energy \[Origin\]:** Spiritual Energy is a natural energy generated by living creatures. The more technical aspects of Spiritual Energy are described in the Life On Aranth section above. But beyond serving as a means of practical energy generation, Spiritual Energy is the most common fuel for powers. Most outright superpowers in the setting are on some level fueled by Spiritual Energy.

  In most cases, Spiritual Energy produces powers by two equally important means. Primarily, and best known to most people, is that Spiritual Energy serves as fuel for powers. When a Dreamer uses its powers, the energy isn't coming from nowhere \- it's coming from that Dreamer's Spiritual Energy. But Spiritual Energy is also what determines the effect of a power. It's somewhat analogous to a program, or a molecule, or DNA. There are elemental units of Spiritual Energy which, when put together in a certain pattern, create the potential for certain reality-altering effects. These patterns of Spiritual Energy are sometimes referred to as "shapes". Channeling energy through the shape produces the effect. Importantly, there is *no* mass-reproducible or \-reusable technology that is able to permanently change the shape of Spiritual Energy so as to produce, alter, or remove powers controllably. There are some unique Dreamtech devices that can do it, but they are small-scale only, usually temporary, and often come with serious side effects or limitations.

  Sufficient levels of Spiritual Energy can also result in substantial physical improvement even without a direct augmentative superpower. This is somewhat limited, and not universal, but it's possible for Spiritual Energy alone to reinforce the body and mind, heighten reflexes, and produce superhuman force in short, immediate bursts. Mechanically, this means Spiritual Energy alone can be used to justify level-appropriate Stamina, defensive stats, and basic attack and damage bonuses for Dreamers and other characters with high Spiritual Energy.

  Spiritual Energy can be detected by appropriate powers and technology. Broad-spectrum Spiritual Energy detection is fairly rare technologically \- most such technology is more specialized for detecting Dreamer powers specifically. The most common form of Spiritual Energy detection comes from Dymaran Chi training \- the most basic skill of Chi is feeling the flow of Spiritual Energy within and around oneself. A basic Detect (Spiritual Energy) power allows one to sense Spiritual Energy from people and animals, and make basic differentiations \- it could tell the difference between an unpowered animal, unpowered human, Dreamer, Null, mage, Chi user, etc. It can also determine the overall magnitude of Spiritual Energy perceived. Acute Detect (Spiritual Energy) can identify people based on their unique Spiritual Energy signature, and can detect the general powerset of Chi users by how their energy flows within them (so it could recognize how skilled one is at Chi, and any special styles they might have such as samurai weapon-bonding or ninjutsu). Analytical Detect (Spiritual Energy) is able to discern Spiritual Energy shapes \- this allows for detection of *active* Dreamer, Null, Magical, Chi, Totemic, and Faith powers, but it requires knowledge to identify them. This means a relevant Expertise check; the DC is 10 for common powers, 20 for uncommon powers, 30 for rare powers, and 40 for unique powers.

  It is possible to become immune to all powers fueled by Spiritual Energy, but this is an extremely broad immunity, requiring 80 ranks. This immunity only covers powers, though; basic stats that are justified as being due to Spiritual Energy are not included (not that immunity to defenses is possible in any case).

  Spiritual Energy cannot be Nullified directly \- it is too broad for even the Broad descriptor, and Nullify alone isn't really a good mechanical fit for negating Spiritual Energy (Spiritual Energy reduction leads to other adverse effects, and negating a character's Spiritual Energy entirely would kill it). To create attacks that target Spiritual Energy powers, come from the other direction with say an Impaired/Disabled/Transformed Affliction (perhaps with a Linked Weaken Stamina or Sleep Damage), with a Quirk that restricts the Transformed condition to only affecting traits based on Spiritual Energy. Alternately, an Entranced/Stunned/Transformed Affliction Limited to Powers is a good way to reflect a power that "unshapes" Spiritual Energy in general, preventing most forms of power use.

  **Dreamer \[Spiritual Energy Source\]:** The most common form of superpower in the setting is Dreamer powers. The \[Dreamer\] origin can justify pretty much any power the GM allows, and some Dreamer powers include innate aptitude for other types of power sets (most mages in the setting, for example, aren't people with actual trained magical skills; they're Dreamers with the power of enhanced magical aptitude or innate magic, kinda like how most super-scientists are Dreamers with powers of super-intelligence or super-inventing).

  While the source of Dreamer powers and the reason they exist is unknown, the technical aspects of how they work is understood. Dreamer powers essentially produce natural shapes in a person's normal flow of Spiritual Energy, so all they have to do is channel energy through those shapes to produce their power's effect. In some cases, the energy flows through the shapes naturally, constantly fueling them, and sometimes the Dreamer can't stop or control it even if it wants to (this is how Permanent or Uncontrolled powers come about). Chi training can be extremely helpful in terms of power control; Dymara has virtually no uncontrolled Dreamer powers. In most cases, cutting off the energy flow or temporarily unshaping the Spiritual Energy will simply end the effect, like disconnecting a light from the socket. But some augmentative effects, typically in more powerful Dreamers and regarding basic physical and mental aptitudes, are more like a cell phone or laptop \- the boost will stick around for a while but fade over time. This is why some Dreamers have naturally-purchased Abilities or defenses that are still justified by their Dreamer powers \- if deprived of their powers for a prolonged period, these boosts may fade, but that's getting into Complication territory. A single Nullify won't do it and it won't happen in the midst of action time. If they have normal Enhanced Traits, though, they're the more "light bulb style", and a Nullification will wipe their boost immediately.

  The technology exists to detect Dreamer powers. Specifically, to detect the natural shapes in a Dreamer's Spiritual Energy and elements that are common to Dreamers, and calculate what they do. Some Dreamers also possess powers allowing them to do so, though these tend to be more intuitive in nature. A basic Detect (Dreamer Powers) sense will discern if a person is a Dreamer or if a phenomenon is a Dreamer power effect, will determine the general magnitude of power, and will determine very broadly the power's overall classification (i.e. physical, energy, mental, aspected, etc). An Acute Detect (Dreamer Powers) sense can identify individuals based on their unique power signatures and will determine the power's type (i.e. paragon, speedster, pyrokinetic, telepath, super-genius, etc). An Analytical Detect (Dreamer Powers) is precise enough to give full mechanical details on all of the target's powers, although in some cases where the base power is simple and more advanced powers are techniques for using it, Expertise (Dreamer Lore) checks may be necessary to figure out what the subject could be capable of.

  Immunity to direct Dreamer powers ("Immunity: All Dreamer Effects") is an immunity to a highly common descriptor, worth 30 points, and covers any sort of Dreamer power that directly affects the target. For example, it would apply to energy blasts, mental effects, conjured projectiles, spells, and so on that are directly produced through Dreamer powers, but not indirect effects like a super-strong punch or a telekinetically hurled boulder. Immunity to all effects fueled by Dreamer powers ("Immunity: All Effects with a Dreamer Origin") costs 40 PP, and would cover indirect effects as well, or at least the Dreamer-power-enhanced portion (a telekinetically-hurled boulder would be ignored entirely because the full force comes from the Dreamer power, but a super-strong punch would simply be downgraded to a regularly-strong punch). However, neither immunity covers objects created merely using Expertise that is Dreamer-power granted, such as Dreamtech or some magical devices (the second one *will* cover objects directly enhanced by Dreamer powers, though the base effects of the object still apply).

  A Broad Nullify can affect Dreamer powers. Afflictions can also be Limited to only affecting Dreamer powers; this counts as Limited (Powers Only) \+ Quirk 2 (Dreamer powers only). The Quirks cannot reduce the final point cost by more than one-third what it would be without the Quirks.

  **Null \[Spiritual Energy Source\]:** Nulls are a type of Dreamer, in that their powers manifest essentially-randomly, are precipitated by a Dream, fueled by Spiritual Energy, and all that. However, Nulls aren't just your average power-nullifying Dreamers. There are certain specific technical differences in how their powers work behind-the-scenes. The biggest one is that while Null powers *are* fueled by Spiritual Energy, they don't actually come with the sort of *increase* in personal Spiritual Energy that Dreamers get. This much is fairly basic information to those who have an understanding of the Null phenomenon (Expertise \[Null Lore\] DC 10, or Expertise \[Dreamer Lore\] DC 20). What is *not* as well known (Expertise \[Null Lore\] DC 20 exclusively) is that Nulls fuel their powers by *absorbing* energy (usually Spiritual, some can absorb other kinds). Their powers are not "shapes" in their personal Spiritual Energy so much as *voids* in it. Most Null powers involve simply drawing energy into these voids, at which point the energy is *gone*. For normal Dreamer powers (as well as magic, Chi, and other Spiritual Energy fueled powers), the energy spent is converted into power effects with some radiating out as essentially waste. It's burned as fuel but not destroyed \- conservation of energy does in fact exist and is maintained. When Nulls absorb power, though, that power is permanently and tracelessly *gone*. This is absolutely why Paradisia sees Nulls as abominations (and for that matter, the Deionists in general and Seekers of the Gods in particular have some serious reservations about them).

  The most basic Null powers involve simply absorbing and nullifying energy. It's theorized that the destroyed energy is tied to how they can return to (")life(") and manifest other abilities thereby, but the specifics aren't known as they're still a fairly new phenomenon and, frankly, the war in Haptarus limits how thoroughly their powers can be studied. In any event, the \[Null\] origin isn't as broad-based as the \[Dreamer\] origin. Primary Null powersets include Immortality 2 (Uncontrollable) and various forms of Dreamer power negation. The latter, however, can expand into any form of power, effect, or energy neutralizing powers by a strong enough Null, and other non-augmentative meta-powers are also possible (such as randomizing or compelling Dreamer powers or even other effects). Revived Null can also receive various physical enhancements. These rarely reach the same levels that Dreamers can, but there's not really an explicit cap.

  Very importantly though, while Nulls are Dreamers, the way their powers work on a technical level is very different. Null powers do *not* count as Dreamer powers for mechanical purposes \- a Detect Dreamer Powers sense won't work on them, Nullify Dreamer Powers won't affect them, Immunity to Dreamer Powers doesn't apply to them, and so on.

  The technology to detect Null powers does exist; in Indelar and Haptarus it's modestly less common than normal Dreamer power detection, though it's very rare and basically limited to Dreamtech elsewhere. It's not as refined as Dreamer detection though. So far, there have not been any confirmed cases of Dreamers who can detect Null powers, although some Nulls are able to detect each other. A basic Detect (Null Powers) sense will discern if someone is a Null and how powerful their Null abilities are, but won't give any further information. An Acute Detect (Null Powers) sense can discern what sorts of energies they can absorb, and will also detect the broad class of revenant they are if a revived Null (i.e. if they have powers like a zombie, specter, ghoul, vampire, etc), although both things require interpretation (Expertise \[Null Lore\] DC 20). Importantly, Acute Null Detection *cannot* be used to identify specific individuals, because Null powers are *voids* \- there are no elements to discern precise signatures from. An Analytical Detect (Null Powers) sense would hypothetically be able to reveal the Null's full powerset (Expertise \[Null Lore\] DC 25 required to interpret) or full mechanical details of all Null powers (DC 30), but the technology is not yet sufficiently advanced for that, restricting it to specific powers and Dreamtech.

  Null powers are rare throughout most of Aranth; they do not generally require the Broad Extra to Nullify. Immunity to All Null Effects costs 10 PP (5 PP for immunity to a single Effect of Null powers, such as Null Damage or Null Nullifies) and will protect against both their power nullification and other metapower effects and their direct energy draining or revenance powers. Immunity to All Effects with a Null Origin (which would also include, say, physical enhancements from revenance) costs 15 PP. However, in an Indelar-focused game, Nulls will be much more common; in these games, the Broad descriptor should be required, and immunity costs doubled. Afflictions Limited to only affecting Null powers are Limited to Powers Only, and then receive a second Limit (non-Indelar game) or Quirk 3 (Indelar game) to restrict them to Null powers. The Quirks cannot reduce the final point cost by more than one-third what it would be without the Quirks.

  **Magical \[Spiritual Energy Source\]:** In Aranth, magic is a technically trainable skill. Specifically, it is the skill of *shaping Spiritual Energy*. A mage can take their own personal Spiritual Energy, or even ambient Spiritual Energy if there's enough of it, shape it into a form capable of producing a power effect, and then spend their own energy to fuel the effect itself. There are some technical differences in spells cast by magic and native Dreamer powers \- the shape of a mage's fire evocation and the shape of a Dreamer's pyrokinesis ability are different \- but the core process of channeling power into Spiritual Energy shapes to produce reality-altering effects is the same, with the main difference being that a Dreamer's powers are a (more-or-less) natural part of them while a mage's spells are learned and constructed with intent (and generally temporary, dispersing back into the constant flow of Spiritual Energy after the spell is complete).

  Magic does, however, require a significant amount of Spiritual Energy to perform, so most efforts to actually study and advance the science of magic throughout the world have ended in failure (much to the dismay of IDEA's Department of Occult Sciences). The exception is Paradisia, where the abundance of Spiritual Energy contained by their Aura (and the fact that everyone's a Dreamer so they have a lot of personal Spiritual Energy) makes magic eminently doable, and Paradisians teach the skill in school right alongside reading, math, and Dreamer lore. *Ritual* magic has also seen some development in some places. Paradisian mages are *especially* strong on-island, but since they're all Dreamers, they can still perform their magic off-island using their personal energy. Paradisia is, however, rather guarded about these capabilities; they don't train Dreamers in magic unless they plan to stay on the island or can be trusted to keep the nature of their magic a secret. That being said, for those who are discrete enough and have sufficient aptitude, Paradisian magical universities are quite capable of teaching pretty much any Dreamer the fundamentals of magic \- enough to manage an off-island spell or two \- with a year or two of dedicated effort, less for those with aptitude.

  That being said, magic isn't a one-size-fits-all skill that once you learn you can do anything with. Each broad magical field is effectively a separate skill in itself, so most mages tend to be either highly specialized, or only have fairly basic abilities in a wider variety of fields, needing effort or preparation to do more. Learning how to conjure matter is as different from learning how to influence minds as learning to construct a building is different from learning how to sway opinions \- except far more complex. Likewise, the difference between producing a flurry of lightning bolts and a devastating ball of fire is like the difference between learning how to play a keyboard compared to how to play a guitar. Individual spells *within* such a subset are more like the individual songs, so once you've achieved proficiency you can learn pretty much anything within your level of mastery in that specific area, but move into another subset or broad field and you're starting from just a bit above scratch.

  Most mages you actually encounter outside of Paradisia are, themselves, Dreamers, but not Dreamers who are Paradisia-trained. Just as some Dreamers have super-inventing as an explicit power which allows them to produce Dreamtech, some Dreamers have *magic* as an explicit power which gives them an intuitive ability to perform magic (and, of course, the normal Dreamer boost to Spiritual Energy with which to fuel their spells). These Dreamers usually have innate understanding of certain specific fields or spells, but they are all capable of learning more with time and training, making magic one of the more versatile powersets out there, given enough practice and study.

  Once you go outside Paradisian training and Dreamer mages, you're pretty much left with rituals. Rituals are the equivalent of finding a light switch in the dark \- a process of immense fumbling that, once someone accomplishes it, is easy enough to repeat in that specific circumstance, but in no way helps you find the switch in a different dark room. They aren't all that well understood scientifically, even in Paradisia, but here's the current primary theory. Spiritual Energy moves. It flows. That much is pretty common knowledge to anyone who's studied the matter. It's the foundation of Chi. Dreamers control their power by controlling how their Spiritual Energy passes through the shapes in the flow. Mages control their energy to produce the shapes that more power is channeled through to create the effects. This is usually done mentally, but many mages and some Dreamers use things like gestures, words, or other props to serve as something on the spectrum of triggers, crutches, or mnemonic devices for it. Movements, thoughts, emotions, words, sensations, objects, and so on produce subtle changes in a person's Spiritual Energy flow. Do *just* the right ones in *just* the right order and you can actually get it into a shape that produces a reality-altering effect. Put enough raw energy through that shape, and it'll fuel the effect just like any other spell or power. Naturally, those with a working knowledge of magical theory are better at figuring out how to perform specific rituals. Importantly, while the basics of a given ritual are often broadly similar, the specifics tend to vary considerably from person to person; a ritualist can learn a ritual and thereafter perform it repeatedly, and they can explain the theory and function to another ritualist to help them work out their own version, but one ritualist usually can't just perfectly duplicate another's ritual to achieve the same result. Naturally, this makes any sort of scientific approach to ritualism *quite* maddening.

  The best-known rituals are those of Peral \- ancient, powerful rituals that have been passed down through oral tradition for millennia. The rites of shamans prime the Hunter, creating the shape of the ritual in its Spiritual Energy, and it is generally the death of a Beast \- as sacrifice or offering \- or of the Hunter itself in sacrifice that provides the fuel to create the effect. But as noted earlier, most rituals vary from user to user, whereas these rites have been passed down shaman to shaman, Keeper to Keeper, for generations. Now, there are indeed some variations between clans and tribes, but the reason the rituals themselves still work is that they aren't *purely* \[Magical\] powers. They also have a \[Faith\] origin. The *belief* in the rituals that the Keepers and the clans show, is an ineffable but indelible component that allows them to continue functioning generation after generation, even where the rules of magic as they are understood say that each new Keeper should have to adapt the ritual anew to its own practices. This \[Magical\] \[Faith\] combination is also responsible for the elemental powers that some Perallan shamans display, as well as the narrative powers of experienced Keepers, although in both cases, the effects tend to be minor without either substantial totemic augmentation, or Dreamer-level Spiritual Energy. In short, Perallan shamans do know magic, but it's a magic so ancient and primitive that the rules behind it aren't known \- it's just the knowledge of how to do it that has been passed down from ancient times, the power kept alive as much by the belief of the people as by the passing down of the lore itself.

  As with Dreamer powers, there is no hard limit for what magic is capable of; it can justify any power allowed by the GM. \[Aura\] and \[Blood Magic\] are both descriptors that are added to relevant \[Magical\] powers.

  There's no standard technology for detecting magic, though it can be done as Dreamtech. Most magical detection comes from other spells or enchanted devices (or Dreamer powers, specifically of magical Dreamers). A basic Detect (Magic) power will determine if a phenomenon is magical, will detect active magic on creatures and objects, and will broadly determine the potency of the magic and its general scope of effect (think D\&D magic schools), but will *not* indicate characters who are capable of performing magic themselves, though it will detect *if* a given character is *performing* magic actively. Acute Detect (Magic) can give more information about magical phenomena perceived, although Expertise (Magic) checks may be required to identify the details, with the DC depending on the complexity of the spell. It can also distinguish between the casters of different magical phenomena. Analytical Detect (Magic) can potentially reveal the full mechanical details of a magical phenomenon, with a successful Expertise (Magic) check, and *is* able to determine if specific characters are capable of magic and broadly what sort of magic they are capable of by analyzing trace elements in their Spiritual Energy left over from their prior spells.

  Magical powers are fairly rare throughout most of Aranth, but the sheer breadth of possibility they allow mean the Broad descriptor is required to Nullify them. Immunity to direct magical effects is a 20-point immunity, and would protect against all forms of direct magical attack (energy blasts, curses, direct telekinetic force, enchantments, etc) but not from physical blows and weapons enhanced by magic. Immunity to All Effects with a Magical Origin costs 30 points and would protect against the magical portion of any attack produced by or enhanced with magic. Note that the \[Magical\] origin is different from the \[Magic\] descriptor, which covers powers where the effect itself is straight-up magical power (such as a mana bolt or a curse, but not a magical fireball which is \[Magical\] origin but \[Energy\] \[Fire\] descriptor). The \[Magic\] descriptor is a normal descriptor for immunities (10 point for all Effects, 5 points for single Effect). Afflictions Limited to Magic would be Limited (Powers Only) and Limited (Magical Only). In a game centered in Paradisia, the second Limit would be reduced to Quirk 2 (the Quirks can't reduce the power's final cost by more than one-third what it would be without the Quirks).

  **Chi \[Spiritual Energy Source\]:** The iconic power of Dymara, Chi is the *skill* of controlling the *flow* of Spiritual Energy through the body. While this can produce impressive effects, especially given sufficient volume of Spiritual Energy, it has nothing to do with the *shape* of Spiritual Energy, so it isn't capable of producing outright reality-altering effects like Dreamer powers and magic can. Chi powers can make one *superhuman*, but not really *supernatural*...although it wouldn't be entirely unfair to say that sufficiently advanced wushu can sometimes be indistinguishable from magic.

  The most basic effects of Spiritual Energy are most important when determining what Chi can do. Spiritual Energy can reinforce the body and mind, quicken reflexes and action. It is above and beyond all *energy*, and that means it is capable of producing velocity and momentum. This is why super martial arts and parkour are so common in Dymara; Dymarans literally move their Spiritual Energy like a muscle to produce *way more force* than their flesh-and-blood muscles are capable of, allowing them to strike with tremendous speed and power, or jump amazingly high. They focus their energy into their skin and muscle and bones to toughen them against blows. Advanced practitioners can *fly* just by mentally raising their Spiritual Energy, bringing their body along for the ride, or shunt their Spiritual Energy elsewhere so *fast* that their body appears to dematerialize to follow it, an expert-level technique called the "flash step". Those with sufficiently high volumes of Spiritual Energy can even force it *outside* of their bodies in powerful energy blasts or barriers.

  While basic Chi powers can be amazing things, they aren't the only benefit of Chi training. Chi treats Spiritual Energy as a muscle, and it can be exercised like one, building it up over time. This can be useful for anyone, but especially Dreamers, allowing a Dreamer of only modest power to develop incredible abilities. Chi training can also help a Dreamer better control its powers; uncontrolled Dreamer powers are almost unheard of in Dymara. And, though this is little-known to much of the world, the skills of Chi (controlling the *flow* of Spiritual Energy) and magic (controlling the *shape* of Spiritual Energy) synergize extremely well, allowing a wizard who casts spells as easily as taking a step or throwing a punch. You generally only see this combination of skills in Dymaran Dreamers with the power of magical aptitude, or in Paradisians who emigrated from Dymara.

  You don't detect Chi itself as something separate from Spiritual Energy. The most basic skill of Chi is a "Chi sense", but that's a Detect (Spiritual Energy) power. Detect (Chi) is basically just another way to put Detect (Spiritual Energy).

  Chi powers are rare throughout most of Aranth; they do not generally require the Broad Extra to Nullify, but it should be required in a game focused on Dymara. Immunity to Chi functions as a descriptor-level immunity, protecting against *direct* Chi blasts or Chi manipulations, but since most uses of Chi are just "really high physical ability", there is no immunity to Chi as an origin. Specific physical immunities (such as to Bludgeoning, Kinetic, or even Toughness), however, can be Limited to attacks with a Chi origin. Afflictions Limited to only affecting Chi powers are Limited to Powers Only, and then receive a second Limit (non-Dymara game) or Quirk 2 (Dymara game) to restrict them to Chi powers. The Quirks cannot reduce the final point cost by more than one-third what it would be without the Quirks.

  **Totemic \[Spiritual Energy Source\]:** Totemic powers have a similar profile to Chi powers, but are different from a technical standpoint. A Totemic power is a physical (most often), perceptual (fairly often), physiological (occasionally), or personal mental (rarely) power received due to certain Perallan Totemic rituals. Note that the rituals themselves aren't \[Totemic\] in origin (they're \[Magical\] and \[Faith\] as noted above), and the "powers" of the Beasts tend to be \[Native\] in nature like those of any animal, although some ancient Beasts, revered by centuries of Perallan clans and gifted offerings and even sacrifices from generations of shamans have developed their own \[Totemic\] powers as well. Totemic powers are the lasting effects of the rituals being completed, not the rituals themselves. What these rituals *actually* do, once you get past the mysticism, is connect the recipient's Spiritual Energy to that of the totem Beast that was the subject of the ritual. For example, the Rite of Sacrifice allows the Hunter to consume a portion of the Beast's Spiritual Energy, adding it directly to its own. The Rite of Offering creates a bond between Hunter and Beast that allows for communication, command, possibly even summoning. The Rite of Sacrifice allows the Hunter's Spiritual Energy, and perhaps a portion of its consciousness, to be absorbed into the Beast, potentially granting it empathy, sentience, or even creating a crude Spiritual Energy shape that allows for shapeshift between animal and human forms.

  While it's not impossible for Totemic rituals to result in lasting Spiritual Energy shapes, the ones that actually do are rare, specific, and usually require Dreamer-level Spiritual Energy to go that far in the first place. For the most part, they are direct enhancements to Spiritual Energy, so like Chi they tend to have predominantly physical effects. But because they are the result of magic, they can go a bit further. Specifically, the bond or energy gained carries with it some of the essence of the Beast. The energy flows differently, in more primal patterns, and carries with it some of the strength of the Beast from which it was derived. Totemic powers, thus, often relate directly to the animals that were involved in the rite. Perform the Rite of Sacrifice on a wolf, a bear, and a lion, and they'll all boost your overall Spiritual Energy. But the wolf might also sharpen your sense of smell or give you a certain pack instinct, the bear might make you noticeably physically stronger, and the lion might add strength and sharpness to your nails, speed to your movements, or even volume to your voice.

  As with Chi training, Totemic enhancements can be valuable to Dreamers who can acquire them, as augmentations to Spiritual Energy boost Dreamer powers thereby. Unlike Chi training, they don't necessarily improve control, and in some cases can actually hamper it, as the primal energies of the Beasts influence the flow of energy. Dreamers with Totemic powers often find their own powers growing more primal or animalistic in nature and in thematics \- an energy controller might start producing conjured beasts of energy that attack its foes, a telepath might loose the id of rampaging animals into its enemies' minds, and so on.

  There isn't any standard technology to detect Totemic powers, but it's not impossible for powers or Dreamtech. Some shamans can also sense it, and there are tales of Perallan Hunters so deeply connected to the spirits of the Beasts that they can sense the mark of a Beast's spirit upon other humans at a glance. A basic Detect (Totemic) power will be able to tell if a subject has Totemic powers at all, and can differentiate broadly between the rites it may have received. An Acute Detect (Totemic) power can identify individuals by the unique feel of the Totemic energies within them, and can identify the specific Beasts they have gained energy from. An Analytical Detect (Totemic) power will reveal the full mechanical details of any Totemic power the subject has.

  Totemic powers are rare throughout most of Aranth; they do not generally require the Broad Extra to Nullify, but it should be required in a game focused on Peral. Totemic powers mainly enhance other traits, and unlike Chi there aren't really any direct Totemic attacks like energy blasts or disrupting the flow of a target's Spiritual Energy, so there's no such thing as an Immunity to Totemic powers, though other Immunities can be Limited to attacks improved by Totemic powers. Afflictions Limited to only affecting Totemic powers are Limited to Powers Only, and then receive a second Limit (non-Perallan game) or Quirk 3 (Perallan game) to restrict them to Totemic powers. The Quirks cannot reduce the final point cost by more than one-third what it would be without the Quirks.

  **Faith \[Spiritual Energy Source\]:** Of all the power types drawn from Spiritual Energy, Faith is, perhaps by its nature, the least understood. The \[Faith\] origin can be found in the Blessings provided by the major religions, as a component in Perallan rites, in the healing and connecting powers of the Disciples of the Way, and sometimes in minor abilities of truly devout people that could just as easily be from dedicated study, strength of will, force of personality, or sheer good luck. Or, of course, in some Dreamers whose power itself is a manifestation of their own belief in the divine. The truly devout say that Faith powers exist as blessings from the divine. Those who believe in their existence but feel the need to fit them into existing lore say that the sheer strength of a person's belief can, gradually, over time, sway their Spiritual Energy like a ritual, eventually forming a shape that energy can pass through to generate reality-altering effects, albeit usually only subtle and minor ones unless backed by a more serious powerset. Non-believers simply say they're just other types of powers that these people are trying to assign divine significance to at best, or in some cases just mere coincidence.

  \[Faith\] on its own can't justify any really flashy powers. The power of Faith is subtle, but no less significant for all that. Faith powers in themselves tend to be things that might be confused for strong will, good luck, or the like. You'll never see an otherwise-normal person healing wounds through the strength of their faith, or calling down divine fire to smite a foe. But you might see them extolling the wounded to press on beyond their limits, or influencing probability just enough that an attack made in defense of another causes far greater effect than would have been expected.

  Of course, put Faith behind Dreamer or Magical powers (or even, to a somewhat lesser degree, Chi or Totemic powers), and it can go a lot further. In this way, the \[Faith\] origin tends to *expand* on a powerset. A Dreamer with the power to control fire and a sincere faith in the Nature might gain the ability to invoke both heat *and cold* in the service of Balance. The ability to reduce temperature has nothing to do with the Dreamer's original power, but develops through divine blessing or raw belief (or maybe, an unbeliever would say, the Dreamer just discovered or developed a new wrinkle to its power; Dreamers figure out new tricks or develop expanded powersets all the time). That same fire controller, if a devout Seeker of the Dream, might gain the power to burn away harmful Dreamer power effects or even place a curse upon Dreamers that burns them if they try to use their powers. If a Keeper of Legend and Legacy, it might gain the ability to summon forth an aspect of Abdullah Lawerenz, a mythic Perallan hero who struck down Beasts with his flaming sword.

  There is no way to strictly detect \[Faith\] powers, and all \[Faith\] powers are tied to some other origin that they can be detected as; \[Native\] for minor standalone powers, while the advanced ones share whatever origin they are supplementing (so the above fire controlling Dreamers would have their basic \[Dreamer\] fire powers, and then their more advanced \[Dreamer\] \[Faith\] powers). It is possible for certain Dreamtech devices, typically those with telepathic elements, to detect \[Faith\] powers in the sense of detecting powers that the recipient *believes* are divinely-gifted, but that doesn't actually confirm whether or not they are. And Dreamers could have the power to detect \[Faith\] powers, but Dreamer powers can absolutely prove anything whether it's true or not, so that doesn't help much. A basic Detect (Faith) power would detect if the subject has a strong religious belief in something, and broadly detect what religion it follows. Acute Detect (Faith) could identify individuals by their unique patterns of belief, and can potentially be used to gain more information about what they believe with an Expertise (Theology) check. Analytical Detect (Faith) could also detect what powers they believe themselves to be capable of due to their faith or to divine blessing, although the exact details of these powers are not revealed, just what the subject believes them to be. Analytical Detect (Faith) also can determine how strong a target's belief is, and can sense the burden of any failings or "sins" the target committed in the past in regards to its faith.

  It's possible to Nullify \[Faith\] powers, but the Nullify has to have a \[Faith\] origin itself \- you can't change a person's beliefs with a Nullify, but you can put the strength of your own belief (or god) against theirs. These Nullifies don't have the Broad Extra, and only the most fanatical of believers can usually manage to justify the Effortless Extra. Immunity to Faith is a normal descriptor; 10 PP for all Effects, 5 PP for one Effect, but this only applies to powers that are direct \[Faith\] attacks (typically from Dreamers with divine powersets), such as divine smites and curses; the above pyrokinetic Dreamers whose Dreamer powers were expanded by their faith could still affect you, for example. You can also Limit other types of immunities to powers with a \[Faith\] origin. Afflictions Limited to \[Faith\] powers is always a double-limit.

  **Technological \[Origin\]:** Modern technology on Aranth is in many fields competitive with Dreamer powers. The \[Technological\] origin is used for electronic, computerized, and other powered devices. Objects that function using purely physical and chemical interactions are considered \[Mechanical\] rather than \[Technological\]. As a good rule of thumb, if it's powered by electricity or processes data, it's \[Technological\], otherwise it's probably \[Mechanical\] (although there are certain edge-cases, such as magical devices which are \[Magical\] in nature).

  The \[Technological\] origin can justify pretty much any sort of power, although some of the more advanced or out there powers also require a \[Dreamtech\] source. Some examples of things that don't require Dreamtech include: directed energy weapons and devices (such as forcefield generators), sci-fi level nanotechnology, near-perfect artificial intelligence, sensory equipment capable of detecting more-or-less anything that science is able to prove exists (although it may take Dreamtech to actually analyze it), and technology that can block or suppress Dreamer powers. Examples of Aranthian technology that require Dreamtech include teleportation devices, matter generators, FTL travel, fully sentient AIs, and technology that can induce, remove, or enhance Dreamer powers.

  It is possible to have technological devices (or Dreamer powers) that, themselves, detect technology. A basic Detect (Technology) power can determine if an object is technological in nature, whether or not it is Dreamtech, and what it's power source is assuming it's a known power source (a hypothetical alien device that uses something entirely different from anything on Aranth would be detected as technology with an "other" power source). An Acute Detect (Technology) power provides schematics on the device which can then be interpreted with a Technology check (depending on how advanced the device is, but typically DC 10 for standard commercial technology, 15 for advanced or new commercial technology or standard military technology, 20 for advanced or new military technology, 25 for custom technology, standard PitTech, or relatively-normal Dreamtech, 30 for custom Dreamtech or advanced PitTech, 35 for custom PitTech, and 40 for hypothetical technologies) to determine the device's general function and purpose. Acute Detect (Technology) can also flag similarities to other observed technology to recognize say if two devices were created by the same person. An Analytical Detect (Technology) power provides a \+5 cirucmstance bonus to the Technology check to discern the device's function, and provides full details on the device's powers if the check succeeds by two degrees or more.

  Nullifying Technology requires the Broad Extra. Technological immunities would be huge game-changers in Aranth; Dreamer powers may be the main form of supernatural ability, but technology is everywhere. Immunity to direct technological effects would be 60 points, and Immunity to all effects generated by Technology would be 80\. Afflictions that only apply towards traits provided or improved by technology would be a single Limit (Limited to Technological Traits).

  **Practical Energy \[Technological Source\]:** "Practical energy" is a catchall term for modern energy generation, collection, and storage methods that at the end of the day usually end up outputting electricity. Most devices that use practical energy either plug into an electrical socket, drawing power from the grid, are outfitted with their own energy collection technology (usually solar collection paint), or are fueled by modern power cells.

  Almost all \[Technological\] devices in modern times use practical energy; powers that interact with the \[Technological\] origin but are restricted to the \[Practical Energy\] source won't see any meaningful hindrance in most games; treat this as a Complication.

  **Dreamtech \[Technological Source\]:** Dreamtech is, quite simply, technology that breaks the rules. Dreamtech is able to do anything the same way Dreamers are able to do anything \- that is, while there isn't necessarily Dreamtech in existence that can do any given thing, nobody has yet to conclusively prove any hard limits for the absolute potential of Dreamtech. As the name implies, Dreamtech is mostly \- but, and this is very important to note, *not always* \- created by Dreamers. So, how does it work?

  Well, it's actually more-or-less accurate to say it works like magic. Literally. Few are the Dreamtech developers who pretend they are actually making use of advanced scientific know-how to do what they do. Many of them *have* cutting-edge scientific skills, sure, but that really just gives them a convenient language for describing *all the rules they're breaking*. The way a typical Dreamtech device is created is that first, the inventor gets as far as it can given the science it knows, the resources it has available, and the limits of the laws of physics. The closer the base invention is to the final goal, the *more likely* it is to work as Dreamtech. This doesn't mean inherently flawed devices can't ever work, but it's definitely harder and way less reliable.

  Once the base invention is as close as it can get to the goal, the inventor starts...tinkering. Similarly to ritual magic, it's a bunch of little actions that cause subtle shifts in the inventor's Spiritual Energy that if done just right will form a shape that will basically alter reality just enough to handle the bits that the limits of skill or resources or physical law can't. Skilled technicians who can create near-functional base devices require much less complex shapes and less energy to fuel them, and they also better know *what* the actual limits are that they have to overcome, which can help the process. Experienced Dreamtech inventors, like experienced ritualists, begin to develop a sense of what will shift their Spiritual Energy in the right way, allowing them to create more ambitious Dreamtech. Dreamers with super-intelligence can learn both skills better just like they can learn any skill better, and Dreamers with super-inventing have an augmented aptitude for both skills and may even have the "shapes" for certain inventions hovering naturally in their Spiritual Energy like any other Dreamer powers. Many Dreamtech scientists also consider *inspiration* to be an important component of their work. Coming up with an insight into *how* a device might theoretically work does seem to have some correlation with shaping one's Spiritual Energy in such a way to do it, although this is more pronounced in Dreamer inventors in general and those with an explicit super-inventing power in particular.

  So, does this make Dreamtech magical items? Well, no. Strictly speaking, a *magical device* is a device that is imbued with its own charge of Spiritual Energy which, itself, is imbued in a shape that allows for the effect it produces. A magical device then is effectively the *source* of a power, whereas a Dreamtech device is more a *target* of a power \- the former is able to change reality in a certain way, the latter is able to do something a normal device can't do because *its* reality has *been* changed in a certain way. A Paradisian Gate is imbued with energy that has been shaped in such a way as to allow the generation of a portal. Hero Corps teleporters are devices that come about as close to generating portals as should be scientifically possible, and then some Dreamer inventor started tinkering with them until reality changed in just the right way to allow them to generate portals in flagrant defiance of all the reasons they originally were not able to do so.

  If this whole process sounds like it might be rather risky \- if, for example, you're wondering what stops reality from changing in a specific way that instead causes the device to, say, blow up in the inventor's face, or open some vortex in space that threatens to consume half the city, or become giant, animate, and hostile to all life \- well, now you understand why IDEA has the reputation it has.

  Effects that normally operate on \[Technological\] devices that are restricted to Dreamtech have Quirk 2 on top of any normal limits applied or Extras required. The Quirks cannot reduce the final point cost by more than one-third what it would be without the Quirks.

  A role playing game is three things. It is an interactive story, a game of chance, and a process in critical thinking.

  **Skill \[Origin\]:** Not everybody has amazing special powers fueled by some sort of inner personal battery, or wondrous technology that may or may not exceed the objective potential of physics. Some people have to get by with just their own talent, drive, and will. And flame-blast if some of them don't just manage it, but manage to compete with the above.

  Powers with a \[Skill\] origin are extraordinary for sure, but they aren't actually superhuman or supernatural. Well, for the most part. To be fair, between everyone having Spiritual Energy, the challenges of competing with Dreamer powers and advanced technology, and the simple fact that this is a superhero setting and adding more awesomeness to the world can't ever be wrong, what counts as "humanly possible" isn't striiiiiictly the same as the real world's definition of that. Even so, \[Skill\] origin powers do have hard limits. As a rule of thumb, they can't justify anything that would be flatly physically impossible for a human being to accomplish. But things that are merely *prohibitively difficult*, *extremely unlikely to happen more than once*, or *only possible for humans in theory*...eh, why not? So no amount of skill is going to let you conjure matter from thin air, teleport from place to place, shoot fire from your hands, or even run all *that* fast on a superhuman scale. But it can definitely give you "action movie hero" level abilities.

  There isn't really technology to detect \[Skill\] origin powers. Custom Dreamtech or specialized Dreamer powers can do it, sure, but actually the most common means of detecting \[Skill\] origin powers are, themselves, \[Skill\]-based, reflecting an incredible ability to gauge the skills of others, or a sort of "greater Assessment" ability. To use a Detect (Skill) power at all, you first need the Assessment advantage, as these powers directly improve on it. For purposes of the details learned from the detection, the Assessment has a minimum DC of 20, even if the subject rolled lower on its Deception check (if you beat their Deception check but not the minimum DC, you get normal Assessment information only). With basic Detect (Skill), you get full details from the Assessment advantage with even a single degree of success (considering the minimum DC), and cannot get false information from Assessment. With Acute Detect (Skill), on a successful Assessment, you can immediately learn the exact mechanics of any skill, advantage, or \[Skill\] origin power you witness the character using, and with appropriate Expertise skills you might be able to get some fluff details, such as recognizing a martial artist and identifying their dojo or teacher from their fighting style. With Analytical Detect (Skill), on a two-degree success on an Assessment, you learn the full mechanical details of all \[Skill\] origin powers the subject has, and on a three-degree success you learn all of their skills and advantages.

  \[Skill\] origin powers aren't quite Innate \- they are possible to Nullify, and they don't even need a Broad Nullify to do it \- but such Nullification powers are *extremely rare* in-setting. Mainly because you can't actually just "turn off" skills. Skill nullifying powers are things like memory removals that cause you to forget your skills, or age manipulating powers that make you too old or young to perform them...which, in all honesty, are probably better designed as some other type of power. Like an Impaired/Disabled/Transformed Affliction or Weaken All Abilities or something.

  Immunity to skill is impossible, because it's just natural skill and immunity to natural traits is a can of worms that is not smart to open. Likewise, Afflictions can't be Limited to skills, because if they're impairing your skills they're impairing pretty much everything by definition.

  **Native \[Origin\]:** \[Native\] traits are similar to \[Skill\] traits, except they're natural to the character rather than trained. Typically, these come from having a *specific body part* capable of producing the effects. For example, claws, teeth, wings, venom glands, and so on. Raw physical attributes such as size, strength, and speed are usually \[Native\] in origin, but these tend to *also* have the Innate Extra. The \[Native\] origin can justify any powers that are physically reasonable for the creature to be able to perform given its physical form...for a generous interpretation of physically reasonable anyway (the square-cube law, for example, can go die in a fire).

  Detect (Native) senses don't exist, because honestly they're not necessary. Claws and fangs and wings don't exactly require special senses to figure out. Worst case you might need a Perception or Expertise (Biology or Survival) check to notice a poison stinger or know that that color snake is venomous or whatever. Closest you'd generally need to a super-sense for it is Penetrates Concealment vision to see anything weird going on inside the subject.

  \[Native\] powers aren't necessarily Innate, but like \[Skill\] Nullification for them is rare and tends to be a kinda weird way to build a power that can probably be better designed as an Affliction or something. Like, yes, technically, you can make a net as a weird Nullify Native Powers thing, and it wouldn't even need broad, but honestly wouldn't a Vulnerable/Defenseless/Paralyzed Prowess-resisted Affliction with Enhanced Extra (Extra Condition \[Dazed/Stunned/Incapacitated\]; Limited to Physical Actions) be more precise?

  Immunities and Limits to \[Native\] powers are impossible for the same reasons as they are for \[Skill\] powers.

  **Braizen \[Source\]:** Braizen radiation is the strange energy derived from Braizen pits, and is a separate Source for \[Technological\] or \[Native\] origin powers; a power with a \[Technological\] origin and a \[Braizen\] source is PitTech, while a power with a \[Native\] origin and a \[Braizen\] source is a Braizen mutation. Generally speaking, powers that interact with Braizen radiation should be built to interact with \[Native\] or \[Technological\] powers and then double-limited to those with a \[Braizen\] source; in a Braizen Isles game, Braizen powers will be more common, so this should only be a single Limit.

  **Technopathy \[Descriptor\]:** Technopathy generally means psychically interfacing with machines. The \[Technopathy\] descriptor is kind of like a version of the \[Mental\] descriptor that affects machines rather than living beings. \[Technopathy\] powers must have the Affects Objects Extra (typically Objects Only, but it's not impossible to have a "teletechnopathy" power that Affects Objects and Creatures and counts as Technopathy for objects and Mental for characters).

  Normal mechanical objects are subject to the \[Technopathy\] descriptor automatically, even though their Absent abilities make them immune to the \[Mental\] descriptor.

  Characters by default are *not* subject to \[Technopathy\]. A fully mechanical character can take a Feature and Quirk to become subject to \[Technopathy\] in exchange for becoming immune to \[Mental\], without taking any absent Abilities. A partially mechanical character (such as a cyborg) may be partially or fully subject to \[Technopathy\] as a Complication. A character's mechanical devices are subject to \[Technopathy\] automatically.

  Any defenses against, or vulnerabilities to, \[Technopathy\] effects also apply to mundane hacking attempts, as well as Matrix-based attacks. Immunity to \[Technopathy\] for a mechanical character costs 20 ranks, the same as immunity to \[Mental\] would for a normal character. A partially mechanical character who takes any level of immunity or partial resistance to \[Technopathy\] treats it as the descriptor it is naturally susceptible to, and \[Mental\] as the descriptor it is susceptible to as a Complication.

  **Projection \[Descriptor\]:** A projection is any power that can pass through barriers or target without line of effect, such as Insubstantial, Permeate, Indirect, Teleport, Remote Sensing, Communication, and so on. An object with immunity to projections can block projections normally, such as preventing an insubstantial character from passing through it or a character from teleporting past it.
