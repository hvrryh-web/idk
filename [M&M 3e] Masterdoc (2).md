**Nerdy Number Crunching \- The Aranth Economy**

With things like superpowers, sci-fi level robotics and technology, and the occasional bit of actual magic all going on in the setting, there are obviously some major differences in the day-to-day mundanities of life on Aranth, and that definitely extends to its economic system. Aranth isn't quite *entirely* post-scarcity, but it's pretty darn close.

**The Energy Credit:** All countries on Aranth use the "credit" as money. That actually has nothing to do with the credit system as we have it on Earth (though that also exists); a credit is short for an "energy credit". In addition to a financial standard, a credit is a unit of measurement for energy. Specifically, one credit is the amount of energy it takes to power an average Aranthian household for a week. While Aranth has a lot of advanced technology that can have high energy costs, its mundane technology has developed more towards energy efficiency; the average Aranthian household requires just 5 Kwh of power per day, making one credit equal to 40 Kwh or 144 megajoules of energy.

**Matter Generation:** One of the two most important pillars of Aranthian economics is in the existence of *matter generators*. Matter generators are devices that do exactly what their name suggests \- they generate matter at a cost in energy.

Matter generators are *Dreamtech*, they don't operate by physical principles. They're not converting energy to matter; they take energy to fuel, and like a Dreamer power, do something weird to how reality works and the result is you get matter. The amount of energy it costs to generate matter varies some; artificial materials are generally easier to produce than natural ones by up to a couple orders of magnitude, although water is about as easy as any artificial material. One credit of energy can generally produce something like four-hundred calories worth of food, or some thirty pounds of plastic. It'll produce some 500 to 1,000 rounds of ammo in a matter factory, but you'll be spending a credit or two a shot using an amfab.

Matter generators are in use throughout the world, although Peral has comparatively little energy to work with (no big loss, since they also have by far the most abundant natural resources). Ilessia, Limbra, and Gil have the most significant matter-generation capabilities, being the only three countries which could theoretically produce sufficient food, clean water, wood, stone, and metal to completely obviate mundane production or acquisition of those resources if they needed to. They don't actually do so though; generated matter tends to be just vaguely "not as good" as the real deal \- food is a bit blander and less nutritious, water is a bit flatter and doesn't feel *quite* as clean, materials are just slightly less durable and look just ever-so-vaguely fake. It's nothing you'd notice if using them exclusively, but it's easily discernable by comparison with natural things.

As a result, matter generators are *primarily* used for producing stuff that is artificial in the first place, such as plastic. There's no real difference there, and since matter generators are Dreamtech, they tend to be more efficient than normal production methods for such materials (especially since you don't have to first produce the raw materials and then create what you actually want, you can just produce the final product outright). They also serve as a sort of fallback for production. The old saying that you can't eat money isn't false on Aranth, but you *can* convert money directly to food. If normal production methods were unavailable for whatever reason, or insufficient to satisfy demand, matter generation is available as a supplement.

What most people think of when they think of matter generators are "matter factories" \- these are large, efficient, and can produce huge volumes of goods rapidly as long as the energy keeps flowing. Each generator has to be designed to produce specific types of matter \- the more different types of matter a given generator the produce, the more complicated and costly it will be to build (but not to run). Once you can create matter, you can also program the generator to create specific things out of it. Programs are much easier to create than the generators themselves (no Dreamtech skills required, it's not much more complicated than designing a template for a 3-D printer), but endlessly diverse. Skilled matter programmers are in high demand by big production companies. More complex matter is generally more costly to produce, though efficiency can vary within a modest range based on the skill of the developer or programmer.

Matter generators can also be made smaller, though. The most common example is ammo fabricators, or amfabs, which produce a single type of ammunition and provide the energy necessary to launch them. Amfabs are still Dreamtech, but they're way simpler than full-fledged matter factories, and are somewhat more common than projection blockers, though still not super-common. They simply use standard power cells (which most weapons already use since most modern Aranthian weapons utilize railgun technology for propulsion) to produce new ammunition as it is expended, negating the need for reloading as long as the cell has energy. They are, however, much more expensive than just normal ammunition (which can, itself, be produced in matter factories). You generally see amfabs only among special forces, power-armored combatants, and similar warriors who make use of cutting-edge tech.

While matter can be generated cheaply, nothing's entirely free; converting generated matter back to energy runs up against *sharply* diminishing returns, as some of the energy is simply *lost* for reasons that modern science hasn't quite been able to figure out but they're pretty sure has something to do with entropy always winning. When you're talking basic caloric intake from food, it's trivial. Matter-generated explosives are about at the point where it about evens out; producing an explosive with a matter generator will cost roughly as much energy as it takes to produce the explosive force itself directly. If you try to convert matter straight back to energy by producing antimatter, you'll wind up losing all but a tiny fraction of it, not quite enough to reproduce the same volume of matter if it were to get recycled back to the generator.

**Mundane Production:** Just because matter *can* be generated doesn't mean all matter *is* generated. As mentioned above, only Ilessia, Limbra, and Gil really have sufficient generation to use it exclusively, and even they don't, because generated matter is just slightly worse than the real deal. However, the existence of matter generation and the use of energy as money means a certain baseline value is established for material goods. Generated matter is always just slightly but noticeably worse than natural matter. So why would anyone buy generated stuff when they can get natural stuff, all else being equal?

Also worth noting, there's not a wide-open gap between "modern-day production methods" and "Dreamtech matter generators". Aranth science has filled in plenty in between. Genetically-engineered crops can be planted, grown, and harvested over the course of a single season, either swapping to crops better suited to each new season or growing them in huge arboreums that don't care about external weather patterns at all. Mundane farming methodologies have advanced, and are supplemented with lab-grown meats. Fast-growing trees can replace wood supplies within a year of replanting, while metals and ores can be replenished over the course of a few years with mine-seeding procedures. Matter generation is the ultimate fallback, but even discounting it, modern Aranth has no problems with production.

Natural non-artificial matter is also *way* less expensive to *produce* than generated non-artificial matter; while matter generators are stupidly efficient compared to the actual energy cost to create matter, they are still more expensive than the energy expenditure required to power modern production technology, pay workers, etc. Since natural matter is both cheaper and better, it's what most serious producers focus on. However, even when it comes to non-artificial matter, generators do have their advantages. First, they're precise. You can simply generate as much matter as you have a demand for. Second, once set up and programmed, all they need is energy. You can be producing tropical fruits in the middle of a frozen wasteland without any knowledge of farming whatsoever. Any investment back into your production can be used to directly expand what sort of stuff you produce by upgrading the generator or adding to its programming. Third, they're instant. You don't have to plant seeds, let them grow, and harvest them. Or rear animals. Or replant forests or reseed mines. There's no risks of losing crops, or mine collapses, or other flukes (short of the generator itself being damaged or destroyed by outside forces). You just push a button and get what you need. In short, natural production is cheaper and better, but once you have the generator set up and programmed, matter generation is way *easier* and more *certain*.

**Energy Production:** Naturally, though, with energy being so important, energy *production* is critical. The people of Aranth are very, very good at getting the most out of their energy. The vast majority of Aranth energy is produced renewably; non-renewable energy storage mediums, such as coal and oil, are almost entirely outdated.

The main forms of energy production are as follows.

*Nuclear:* Nuclear plants are the biggest individual producers of energy in Aranth save for Gil's matter converters, and in Ilessia are responsible for roughly thirty percent of primary energy production, although the waste is still a concern. Modern nations are containing it safely, but there's plenty of work still being done to improve it. The Braizen Isles are trying hard to get spent fuel rods and the like shipped from other countries, since they'd make amazing fuel for the Pits. However, nobody's been quite crazy enough to do it yet, since you know, *shipping nuclear materials to a rather unstable region*, and all. Ilessia's got around 1,500 nuclear plants, and they each produce about fifty billion credits worth of energy per year on average.

*Solar:* While nuclear plants provide the most energy individually, solar power has emerged as the single biggest source of energy in Aranth, and in Ilessia they clock in at roughly forty percent of primary energy production, or some 100 trillion credits a year. While there are some large scale solar farms, the real reason solar energy has become so significant is advancements in ease of collecting it (and the fact that Aranth solar technology collects at pretty much maximum efficiency). The biggest of these is *solar paint*, which is just what it sounds like \- high-tech paint that absorbs heat from sunlight and converts it to usable energy. Pretty much all buildings and cars (not to mention billboards, traffic lines...pretty much everything that is both painted and outdoors, really) are painted with solar paint, not only providing their power, but usually ensuring a constant flow to the energy grid itself.

*Geomantic:* Geomantic power isn't as big as solar or nuclear, but it still accounts for some twenty percent of Ilessia's primary energy production. Geomantic power comes mainly from geomantic plants, which are power plants that gather energy from what are called "geothermal nodes" \- basically points of significant geological activity relatively near the surface, such as lava pockets or certain fault lines. They take in energy from those nodes and convert it to practical energy. Some geomantic plants are also capable of harnessing electromagnetic energy from the atmosphere to supplement production, especially in regions more prone to storms and other atmospheric activity. Wind farms and hydroelectric dams are also considered geomantic energy. The production capability of any given form of geomantic power varies widely based on its efficiency and the geographical features, although even the smallest nodes generally allow for plants that can produce at least a billion credits a year, and the average is about ten billion. Dams and wind turbines have much lower production, but can still add up. Ilessia's got around 5,000 geomantic plants throughout the country.

**Spiritual Energy:** A new form of energy, only recently fully developed, is spiritual energy. Originally discovered by virtue of Dreamers with spirit-, aura-, or energy-viewing or \-detecting powers (sort of; Dymara's known about Spiritual Energy for millennia, although they didn't call it that and didn't know everything about it that modern science does now), it was eventually concluded that living beings give off some form of ambient energy that doesn't seem tied to their physical, biological energy intake and usage. This does appear to stem from an internal, supernatural source of energy, and is noted as being weaker in animals and stronger, often much stronger, in Dreamers. Plenty of scientific research has been done regarding spiritual energy in the past century, and the following is what is known (or not known) about it:

First and foremost, science has not found any conclusive evidence that this energy or its source is in any way related to or indicative of a "soul" or "spirit" as posited by various religious or mystical traditions. There is no indication that it has anything to do with a person's personality or nature. There is definitely no indication that it maintains any sort of consciousness beyond death or travels to any sort of afterlife (it does appear, upon death, to cease energy production, the energy making it up dispersing into the air, like an object removed from a heat source). That all being said, words like "soul", "spirit", "aura", "life force" and the like are ingrained enough into the public consciousness and generally get the concept across well enough that they've stuck (often to the chagrin of those scientists who study the phenomenon).

The energy is constantly, naturally produced by all living beings. It does not appear to have any measurable biological effect (that is, it isn't increased by say eating more, and it can't sustain a person who stops eating or the like).

The energy is, however, in at least some manner tied to life. Sick, injured, tired, and otherwise weaker individuals produce less of it. Artificially inducing reduced production leads to general weakness, and artificially ceasing production results in death. Artificially increasing production has been known to cause feelings of euphoria and generally improved health, vigor, and physical and mental capability.

The energy is produced at a fairly constant rate. Most of the energy appears to remain within the body, slowly radiating out. Intense activity increases the rate at which it leaves the body. Strong emotion can influence the rate of production. A higher or lower rate of production typically results in proportional output.

The energy appears to be the power source for Dreamer powers (and some other power effects). Active powers tend to draw more energy, particularly when used in rapid succession. How much is drawn for a given power can often (but not always) be consciously chosen by a Dreamer, and the techniques to do so are learnable skills (many children learn the basics of this in school in case they ever have a Dream, and since these techniques have begun to be taught, the rate of uncontrolled Dreamer manifestations has dropped by a third). These techniques are fairly abstract, though, so a lot of people don't really get it, or not until they actually have powers and receive active training with them.

The energy also appears to be the mechanical reason for many superpowers. Certain "shapes" of Spiritual Energy can convert further energy into reality-altering effects.

Dreamers seem to produce well more power than they can tap into at once. Repeated use of active Dreamer powers can drain this energy though, and the amount of drain does appear to negatively influence production.

**Energy Generation:** All this has led to the modern form of unskilled labor: Energy Generation. Basically, letting the ambient spiritual energy your body naturally gives off be collected and sent into the power grid, and receiving energy credits for it. Now, the raw energy that radiates out from a person isn't actually much greater than that which dissipates naturally as heat; maybe a couple hundred watts at rest, for an average person. However, spiritual energy is the fuel for Dreamer powers, and as anyone who's met a Dreamer who can shoot fire or lightning from their hands will tell you, that stuff is *extremely* easy to convert into different forms of energy at a much higher rate of exchange.

So similar to matter generators, you have energy collectors, technology which can gather waste spiritual energy and convert it into a more usable form. Like matter generators, these are Dreamtech \- you need Dreamtech to emulate the "shapes" of spiritual energy that allow for the reality-altering, physics-defying conversion. But they're among the easiest forms of Dreamtech to produce, since they're pretty much just doing exactly what all Dreamers do naturally. They've reached the point where they're *virtually* mass-producible.

At rest or while sleeping, people don't give off much waste energy. Most energy collection facilities, however, are basically set up as gyms (a typical "energy farm" has row upon row of stationary bikes, although variations \- such as tracks, weights, pools, and so on, are not uncommon). Since exertion increases the rate at which the energy radiates out, using such facilities can increase energy production substantially. Dreamers, naturally, can produce significantly more energy even using these basic techniques, but since this is all waste energy, even Dreamers can only push it so far (a strong Dreamer can earn an extremely comfortable living on energy generation, but it's almost certainly the least profitable way to use Dreamer powers for money).

On the one hand, energy generation is something any able-bodied person can do to earn a decent living wage, and it helps you stay fit in the process\! On the other hand, riding a stationary bike all day doesn't exactly give most people a deep sense of fulfillment. Some people love their energy generation jobs, especially when the farms they work at have good amenities and entertainment options. But a lot of people see them as dehumanizing. Thing is, thanks to technological automation (up to and including artificially intelligent robots) and the sheer efficiency of Dreamers in the workforce, these days more and more people are finding themselves relying on energy generation for work, which many people aren't happy about.

In terms of numbers, an average person working an energy generation job actually *gives off* enough energy to convert into 25 credits worth of energy per hour of exertion. Now, this isn't all collected \- modern collection machines are highly efficient, but not perfectly efficient. Most energy farms are able to collect about 80% of the energy, or 20 usable credits an hour. Generally, about 75% of *that*, or 15 credits per hour, is paid to the generator. The average farm then uses about half of its take for business expenses and to provide "amenities" \- food, entertainment, and other services to make the process more enjoyable. The rest is profit for the owner. These are averages though; naturally, some farms will pay out more or less, or spend less or more on amenities, some will charge for amenities (or certain amenities) rather than providing them free, and so on. But of course, a farm's income is based on the number of people working there. Energy farms aren't like an office job where employees get hired. Pretty much anyone can walk in, slot their card into a machine, start working out, and remove the card when finished. There's intense competition between energy farms to attract more workers without cutting too deeply into their profits.

A typical energy farmer works two five-hour shifts per day, five days a week (note: days are 32 hours long in Aranth, and weeks are eight days) with a few hours rest in between. Some put in a "full" six-day week (which is the norm for more structured jobs), but on average they take a day off in the middle of the week somewhere for additional rest. As a rule of thumb, spending more than a quarter of your time doing energy generation (which would be 64 hours a week) is going to be exhausting enough to degrade efficiency long-term. Total production will still increase, but not as much, so most people stick to the normal shifts unless the really need the extra money.

There are also personal devices that can collect energy and send it to the grid in exchange for credits. These tend to be highly inefficient though. Mobile ones, such as certain active crystal devices or exercise accessories, generally collect around 10% of the base generation value. Stationary ones generally range from 20% to 40%. Only the best of consumer-grade collection devices can hit the vicinity of 80% like the professional devices in the farms do. Even so, there are usually good subsidies for these devices, and they typicaly pay for themselves in a year or two.

Current estimates are that in Ilessia somewhere in the vicinity of half the population, or 500,000,000 people, are full-time energy generators, with give-or-take another hundred-million using it for supplemental or occasional income. In Ilessia, between full time generators, part-time generators, prison generation, and personal devices, spiritual energy generation accounts for something like ten percent of primary energy production, or some twenty-five trillion credits a year, about 80% of which comes from full-time energy generators.

But even though it ranks last in terms of major modern energy production methods, energy generation is in some ways more important to the economic face of modern Aranth than any of them. Just like matter generation has set a certain minimum value on goods, energy generation has set a certain minimum value on *labor*. Again, energy generation may not be the most satisfying job you can get, but what it comes down to is you're being paid to exercise, usually while watching TV, reading a book, listening to music, or otherwise provided with your favorite form of entertainment. And any able-bodied individual can do it (and there are plenty of farms out there that have setups for people with various ailments and disabilities as well).

**Energy Storage:** Aranth science is just as good at storing energy as it is producing it. Energy is typically stored in power cells. Power cells can be made as small as beads or postage stamps, and these cells are generally used to power handheld devices and even weapons. Energy-intensive devices, such as forcefield belts or amfab-capable weapons, tend to have cells roughly the size of a real-world triple-A battery. The largest of power cells, the ones that can serve as a generator for a highly energy-intensive facility for a year or store large volumes of power in an energy bank, range in size from that of a car battery to a good roll of paper towels. Power cells usually give off light, with the brightness indicating the amount of charge and the color indicating the maximum output speed for the cell.

Active crystal devices are also capable of storing energy, functioning as their own power cells.

Power cells are fairly tough and highly stable. Simply like breaking one in half or even shattering it into pieces won't release the energy stored within, although it may make getting that energy back *out* difficult. However, there *is* a lot of energy stored in their physical structures; if they are entirely destroyed or blown up, they'll release that energy. They are designed to fail as safely as possible, releasing energy relatively slowly over a large area; destroying a tiny cell will produce a definite shockwave, but it won't cause any meaningful harm. A larger cell might cause a bit of damage and probably knock a person back or down. The big cells can produce hazardous explosions though, and a chain reaction in an energy bank, where one cell explodes destroying other cells and so on, can produce a calamitous detonation with a destructive potential measured in obliterated city blocks.

**Wealth:** Let's start with the basics. An energy-generation job isn't just barely scraping by in poverty. Actual poverty is extremely rare in Aranth and any sort of systemic poverty is generally sign of a major economic crisis or serious exploitation. Remember, the food standard is roughly 1 credit per 400 calories. Taking into account the increased length of an Aranthian day and the intense activity involved in energy generation, your typical energy farmer is looking at an average of some 4,800 calories a day as a healthy diet. That's 12 credits to produce, but of course the producers need to make their profit, so the average cost of a day of basic, matter-generated food for a full-time energy generator is something like 15 credits, or about one of their ten hours of work. Call it one and a half after taking into account days off, the occasional natural food or eating out, and water costs (although those are pretty ludicrously low themselves, since water is the easiest matter to produce and Aranth has perfect desalination technology). Renting a small, simple, but clean and safe apartment, is generally going to run in the vicinity of 600 credits a month, which comes to about two of their generation hours a day. Payments for a simple vehicle, a standard government insurance plan, baseline signal service (which means phone, cable, and internet; at this point they're all just signal), and other standard expenses will usually be roughly the other 1.5 hours, or some 450 credits a month in total. Fuel costs are trivial (remember, the standard of a credit was the amount of energy required to power an average home for a *week*\!) given Aranth's energy efficiency and generally more than covered by energy collection from solar paint on their building and vehicles, so don't even bother budgeting for things like powering your home or fueling your car, it's built into the existing payments. The tax rate in Ilessia at this level of income is 15%, *however* most of these most baseline services (matter-generated food, cheap apartments, basic insurance and signal plans, etc) are provided by the government (the Ilessian government specializes in offering the cheap, efficient, no-frills stuff, and then if you want the cool stuff you can buy it from actual companies), and buying from them gets discounted from your taxes since they're making more of a profit from the purchase (they get a 25% profit when you buy their matter generated food, for example). All told, the baseline cost of living in Ilessia (and many other countries hover roughly around here) can be paid with one shift in energy generation, five days a week. A professional energy farmer does *two* of those, giving them an equal amount of money as discretionary income that they can use for supporting their preferred entertainments, or buying stuff they like, or just getting better baseline stuff, or whatever. And they can easily add a sixth day a week without diminishing efficiency, if they need some extra money.

Again, this is at the most basic level. There are way nicer apartments in better neighborhoods with more amenities, and then there's renting a house, buying a house, bigger houses, etc. You'd be driving a standard-issue ground vehicle, not a cool sports car or flying car or whatever. You'd have a modern smart phone, not one of those fancy Active Crystal Computer Systems, and while your signal service would be plenty strong for normal internet browsing, gaming, and videos, there are definitely faster ones out there. You'll have plenty of nutritious food (and also good access to less-nutritious food, because artificial stuff remains easier to generate than natural), but it's matter-generated and might be somewhat limited in variety compared to buying at a big supermarket. And so on. You won't be impressing anybody. But in terms of general comfort, health, and safety, yeah, you're solid.

But energy generation lets you take care of your monthly expenses and still have money for hobbies, savings, miscellaneous expenditures, and so on. Even if you're providing for a family it's sufficient; you'll be spending more, sure, but it won't be a straight multiple of your expenses (a larger apartment but not a second apartment, more food but certainly not as much as a full-time energy generator consumes, a family insurance plan but that's not anything like directly multiplying the cost of an individual plan, signal is fine, power costs are still trivial so they're fine, etc). Even day care isn't a problem because many energy farms offer day care services, play areas for kids, or the like, because *of course they do* that's extremely attractive to parents and if they know what they're doing they actually make a *profit* off of it because of the spiritual energy of a bunch of kids running around\! Rule of thumb at this income level is that each child will cost something like two daily hours of energy generation, which is doable for a single parent and pretty easy for a couple.

A typical energy farmer earns about 30,000 credits a year. And that baseline cost of living is around half that. So 15,000 a year is considered the poverty line, where you're either just barely, or not quite, scraping by with the bare minimum that you need for what Aranth would consider a fairly spartan, but comfortable, lifestyle. You're eligible for direct government assistance at that level (and the threshold for assistance goes up if you have dependents). Mechanically, a personal income less than that can generally be considered a Complication.

Going up a notch, you've got the average skilled worker. Since an energy generation job can easily cover basic living expenses, companies don't have nearly as much leverage; it's not a question of choosing between a job you hate and being unable to provide for yourself and your family. It's a question of choosing between a job you hate and energy generation. It'd be a loss, absolutely, but not a life-ruining one. And if you've got skills that automation can't supplant, that's valuable. Skilled workers can add a lot of value to a company. They've also got some fairly powerful unions (the Reclaimers, in particular, support a number of labor unions).

Resultantly, even a basically skilled worker probably isn't even considering a job that makes much less than 80,000 credits a year. They're probably buying less from the government though, so in Ilessia they're paying their full tax rate (which is up to 25% from 60,000 a year on), but that still means they're taking home double what an energy generator produces. Novices \- fully trained, but without any actual work experience \- might be starting as low as 40,000 a year, but if they haven't been brought up to around the eighty-thousand level within some five years, they're probably going to be finding another employer. Your typical skilled worker is making between 80,000 and 150,000 credits a year, with 100,000 being the average.

This, however, is *not* considered Wealth 1\. This is still baseline wealth; you've got nicer stuff and more discretionary income, sure, but it's nothing amazing at a mechanical level. A PL 10 Dreamer can pull in 150,000 credits a year with full-time energy generation.

Wealth 1 starts at roughly 200,000 credits a year. Wealth 2 starts at around 500,000 credits a year. Wealth 3 starts around 2,000,000 credits a year. Wealth 4 starts around 10,000,000 credits a year. Wealth 5 starts around 100,000,000 credits a year.

Now, in terms of general quality of life, this is all pretty excellent. But don't think for a moment that this all means wealth is *evenly* distributed. Remember, something like half the country is doing basic energy generation full time, controlling about 7.5% of the available wealth. Another quarter of the country qualify as skilled workers, so you've basically got the lower and middle classes, the bottom three-quarters of the country, with about 20% of the wealth. Add in the upper-middle-class of Wealth 1 individuals, now you're talking 90% of the population, but still only 35% of the wealth, with the other nearly two-thirds controlled by the top 10%. And nearly *half* the country's wealth is in the hands of the top 2% of the population.

**Robots and Automation:** There are reasons that roughly half of Ilessia works in full-time energy generation, and automation is a big one. Aranth's advanced technology means that most unskilled jobs have been largely automated.

Now, most automation doesn't fully replace the need for human workers, even at Aranth's technology level. Machines can do formulaic work trivially of course, and basic AI software is sufficient for them to do complex tasks; self-driving vehicles, for example, can handle most transportation jobs. Skilled jobs that involve critical thinking and problem-solving skills, though, are still beyond standard machines. More advanced machines and robots with Dreamtech-level AI can do any job a human can do, and can often do it better...but unless you have the Dreamtech skills to build one yourself, you're not going to be just buying a Dreamtech robot and putting it to work forever. You're going to be *leasing* it from the creator, probably along with an insurance and maintenance plan. If you've got the resources for it, sure, you can replace a workforce with robots and probably get some greater efficiency out of the deal, but it's not a no-brainer and it's not an option that's available to all companies.

And of course, machines don't operate independently. Automation can greatly reduce a company's need for unskilled workers, but they'll still need skilled workers to troubleshoot problems, fix glitches, repair damage, oversee the work, and so on.

**Jobs:** Roughly half of Ilessia is performing energy generation. So what's the other half doing? While automation has taken most of the typical unskilled jobs, there are still plenty of options out there for the skilled worker. While not exhaustive, the big categories are as follows:

*Craft Jobs:* You'd think between automated industry and matter generation, there wouldn't be much room left for building stuff. And when you're talking standard stuff, it'd be true enough. But even energy generators can live comfortably on just half of their income, so most people have a solid amount of discretionary income. Professional crafts are a common sign of wealth and status, standing out from mundane matter-generated or mass-produced items. Skilled craftspeople can still earn a very good living in modern Aranth.

*Creative Jobs:* Entertainment is a *massive* industry. Energy generation usually includes entertainment \- you'll be riding a bike or whatever with a screen on the front or maybe wearing some VR goggles or whatever and watching a show, or movie, or reading a novel, or whatever. Your average energy generator is going to consume a *lot* of media. And you can't automate that. But most people are going to want to be entertained.

Aranth in general and Ilessia, as something of the entertainment capital of the world, in particular, has essentially reached the point where getting fans is more useful than trying to collect money for creative work directly. For one thing, a lot of creative work can be done while doing energy generation \- the Aranth version of the starving artist waiting tables while hoping for their big break is largely replaced by artists doing energy generation while working on their art with neural-link computer systems (there are even some energy farms that provide such systems specifically to cater to those sort of workers \- it's actually a pretty good deal, since the emotional energy that goes into creating art can result in increased spiritual energy production). The typical goal for an aspiring artist is just to get their work in front of people. Once people get interested in an artist's work, they might start sending money to fund *future* work (as well as do things like spread the word, request major studios to look at them, etc). Because even energy generators have significant discretionary income, the majority of people on Aranth in general (and, again, in Ilessia in particular) are pretty willing to spend their money to fund more, bigger, and better work from artists and studios they like. So most of the entertainment industry runs more on a system of "That was awesome, let us throw money at you and then you make more things like *that*\!" than "I have this thing that I think you'll find awesome, pay me and you can see it." And there is a lot of money in the industry; it's typical for an energy generator to budget a full one of its five "discretionary" hours worth of daily income to investing in entertainment it likes, which is 300 credits a month, and many will invest more. And that's just the energy generators.

This setup means there is a *lot* of room for independent artists to do their thing, but larger studios, publishers, producers, and so on still have their place. They can put out way more content than any single artist or group, getting broader appeal and more income, which they then use to pay artists. They also charge fees to artists to be able to take advantage of their reach and marketing, generally taking a percentage of independent funding from their affiliated artists. They're also better equipped to provide (and secure) "premiere" content that isn't just automatically streamed out to anyone who wants it, which may include ads or require subscriptions to access. Studios and their affiliated artists tend to come out ahead of independents on balance, but the latter are certainly competitive, and with sufficient skill or a sudden viral following, an independent artist can easily become just as big a celebrity as any big-time studio professional. Officially, there is some rivalry between the groups, but truth is plenty of independents will join a studio if given the opportunity, and plenty of artists who aren't getting what they want from a studio will happily switch back to being independent when their contracts expire.

*Interpersonal Jobs:* A lot of people would rather talk to a human being than a robot, and most people would rather talk to one than some automated call system. Sales, service, support, and similar jobs are all generally staffed by people. Some of these can be on the lower end of the required skill level, but they're still jobs that benefit from being performed by people (and involve *dealing with other people* all day, so you better believe if you want someone doing them you're gonna have to pay them more than they could make on energy generation\!) Of course, while there isn't necessarily a ton of skill required to perform the basic functions of such jobs, having good interpersonal skills certainly helps, and employers will pay attention to such skills in prospective candidates \- after all, if they're going to be spending a skilled worker's wage, they had better be getting some satisfied customers and positive retention values out of it\! Of course, sales and support aren't the only interpersonal jobs out there, and there are some higher-level ones that can bring in wages at the upper ends of the skilled worker level, or even getting into jusification for Wealth benefits, such as psychiatrists, lawyers, high-level personal assistants or trainers, and of course teachers.

*Management Jobs:* Middle management thrives on Aranth every bit as much as on Earth. Flame-blast if I know why. I'd love to say that given Aranth's overall advancement and how its economical system works you don't earn high-paying management jobs unless you really bring some serious business skill to the company, your constant efforts boosting efficiency and profitability every day. But...no, no you can pretty much just climb the corporate ladder by making your bosses like you. Providing somewhat more inherent value, this also includes things like bureaucratic jobs, accounting jobs, financial jobs, and so on.

*Marketing Jobs:* Marketing and advertisement is every bit as big an industry on Aranth as on Earth, and it's not something you can just feed into an algorithm. The people of Aranth have been living with televisions, smart phones, and the internet a lot longer than we have; they're pretty savvy. That said, the tools of the advertiser's trade still work to varying degrees, and skilled marketers are constantly coming up with new ones.

*Scientific Jobs:* All sorts of research and development jobs are well-paid by either individual companties or government grants. Aranth's technology may be highly advanced, but that doesn't mean it's perfect, and a big scientific breakthrough can be an absolute game changer for a company.

*Security Jobs:* Police, fire fighters, soldiers, mercenaries, private security companies, prison guards, computer security specialists, etc. This sort of job has a pretty sizeable mix of both people and robots. The latter are generally both tougher and more expendable and can easily be more powerful if it does come to combat. The former are smarter, better able to make complex decisions in difficult circumstances, and might be able to keep things from devolving into combat in the first place. And of course, any security organization worth its salt will be more than happy to add combat-capable Dreamers to their roster.

*Technical Jobs:* Finally, all those machines doing the unskilled jobs need people to oversee, review, maintain, and fix them\! And in a lot of cases, while the machines can do a lot, they need someone managing them and making decisions; an Aranthian plumber isn't going to unclog a pipe or repair a leak itself, it's going to send a little drone around to do it, probably controlling a dozen of them from a central console in its office and just inputting instructions when they get to points the programming can't do on its own. Most technical jobs allow a single skilled worked to direct multiple machines or robots, and of course more skilled workers who can simultaneously work with larger fleets, better solve the problems the machines can't, and *especially* upgrade the machines with custom functions and programs, are competed for fiercely. That said, since relatively few technicians are needed, there's also a lot of competition among technicians for a relatively limited number of jobs; like interpersonal jobs, a lot of technical jobs are pretty easy to learn how to do the basics of, at least given Aranth's level of advancement and its educational and training resources. So a lot of them are on the lower end of the skill threshold, but not all of them \- an automated system or fleet of robots can get by fine with just someone who can properly maintain them and handle the right inputs, but a truly skilled technician can make much better use out of them. And technical jobs also include high-end, *very* well-paid jobs like engineers, doctors, and matter programmers.

**Dreamers in the Workforce:** Another big part of the reason that so many people are working energy generation jobs is due to the sheer efficiency of Dreamers in the workforce. Quickness 6 alone means you can complete an hour of work in a minute, easily replacing an entire workforce of sixty workers. If you're also more skilled than the average worker, it's like replacing an entire workforce with a workforce of experts. Now, of course, *because* of how automated things are, you do run up against diminishing returns, and speed alone isn't a direct value-multiplier in all jobs. But then, maybe instead of doing the job of an entire workforce you just come in, work for an hour, collect a week's paycheck, and go off to do what you want.

So a Dreamer can't necessarily parlay like measure-boosting powers into a direct income multiplier, but Quickness is pretty much the most straightforward option. Dreamer powers can be used for mundane utility in oodles of ways. Truth is, even the least of Dreamers can usually find ways to turn their powers to earning skilled worker incomes, and a Dreamer with powers typical of PL 5+ can probably manage Wealth 1 on power alone. If you're PL 10+, probably the only reason you wouldn't have Wealth 2 is if you don't bother to go out and get it. And that's being fairly straightforward about things; if you join Big Dreams, Inc. they can set you up to add a rank to those Wealth numbers fairly trivially, for example.

Truth is, pound for pound, automation is still a bigger part of the reason that energy generation is so common than Dreamers in the workforce. But the latter is (especially in Ilessia, where the Reclaimers rail against it constantly) somewhat of a more visible reason. High-end technological automation's been chugging along steadily for like two centuries or so in Aranth; nobody really thinks about all the old jobs that it got rid of any more. But people notice when some hot-shot with Quickness 6 gets an entire company laid off.
