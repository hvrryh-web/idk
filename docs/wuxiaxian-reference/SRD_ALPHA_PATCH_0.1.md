# Section 0: Introduction & Core Concepts

## 0.1 Welcome to WUXUXIANXIA

### What Is This Game?

**WUXUXIANXIA** is a hybrid Visual Novel + Tactical TTRPG that combines:
- **Deep tactical combat** inspired by Fire Emblem and Mutants & Masterminds 3e
- **Cultivation progression** from Xianxia literature (Cradle, I Shall Seal the Heavens, etc.)
- **Visual Novel storytelling** with character-driven narratives
- **Three conflict types** - Violence, social intrigue, and existential horror are all equally viable

### Genre and Setting

You play as **cultivators** - individuals who refine their body, mind, and soul to transcend mortal limitations. Through discipline, tribulation, and the accumulation of spiritual power, cultivators climb from street-level empowered individuals to national heroes, demigods, and eventually cosmic entities that reshape reality itself.

The game takes place across multiple realms:
- **Mortal Realm**: Where most stories begin (SCL 1-10)
- **Spirit Realm**: Higher planes of existence
- **Celestial Realm**: Domain of immortals and gods
- **Cursed Realm**: Source of corruption and forbidden powers
- **The Void Between**: Mysterious spaces between realms

### Core Experience

**At the table, you will:**
- Build complex characters with unique cultivation paths
- Engage in tactical turn-based combat with meaningful resource management
- Progress through cultivation stages, each breakthrough a hard-won achievement
- Face violence, social manipulation, and existential horror
- Pay costs for power - optimization comes with consequences
- Tell stories of ambition, sacrifice, and transcendence

### Inspirations

**Mechanical**:
- **Mutants & Masterminds 3e**: Effect-based powers, Power Level caps, tactical depth
- **Fire Emblem series**: Turn-based tactical combat, class progression

**Thematic**:
- **Cradle** (Will Wight): Structured cultivation system, iterative advancement
- **I Shall Seal the Heavens**: Cosmic scale cultivation, tribulations
- **Reverend Insanity**: Ruthless optimization, costs for power
- **Wuxia/Xianxia genre**: Martial arts, spiritual power, sect politics

---

## 0.3 Core Mechanics Summary

### Roll Resolution

The core mechanic is simple:

**d20 + modifier vs. Difficulty Class (DC)**

- **Natural 1**: Always failure (even if total exceeds DC)
- **Natural 20**: Always success (even if total below DC)
- **Success by 5+**: Extra success (critical hit, or additional effect)
- **Failure by 5+**: Extra failure (fumble, or worsened consequence)

**Opposed Rolls**: Both sides roll d20 + modifier; highest wins.

### The Balance Dial: Soul Core Level (SCL)

**SCL is the hidden number that caps your power.**

Similar to Mutants & Masterminds' Power Level (PL), SCL determines:
- How high your attack and effect ranks can be
- What your maximum defenses can reach
- Roughly how dangerous you are compared to others

**Key Formula**: `Attack Bonus + Effect Rank ≈ 2 × SCL` per conflict type

**SCL ranges**:
- SCL 1-2: Cursed-Sequence (broken, collapsing)
- SCL 3-4: Low-Sequence (street-level)
- SCL 5-7: Mid-Sequence (professional, city-level)
- SCL 8-10: High-Sequence (national heroes, demigods)
- SCL 11+: Transcendent (gods, cosmic entities)

**Player characters typically start at SCL 5-7** (Mid-Sequence).

### Resource Management

Combat uses **four interlocking resources**:

1. **THP (Total Hit Points)**: Your health pool. Reaching 0 means unconscious/dying.
2. **AE (Action Energy)**: Fuel for techniques. Regenerates each round.
3. **Strain**: Overexertion tracker. Accumulates from blocking and forbidden techniques. Death at maximum.
4. **Guard**: Temporary damage absorption. Resets between encounters.

**Design Intent**: You must balance offensive power, defensive resilience, and resource expenditure. No single build dominates all situations.

### Condition Ladders

Instead of HP-only tracking, characters accumulate **conditions** through **three conflict types**:

**Violence (Physical)**: Injured → Maimed → Mortally Wounded → Ruined Body
**Influence (Social)**: Rattled → Discredited → Isolated → Shattered/Broken
**Revelation (Horror)**: Shaken → Haunted → Deranged → Shattered/Broken

**4th Degree conditions** (Ruined Body, Shattered/Broken) **require narrative resolution**, not just recovery rolls. This prevents "heal back to full and repeat" loops for serious consequences.

### Cost Tracks: "Power Draws Blood"

Optimization and power have **consequences**. Three cost tracks accumulate over a campaign:

1. **Blood Track**: Physical strain from glass cannon builds, overexertion, self-harm techniques
2. **Fate Track**: Destiny debt from luck manipulation, oath-breaking, reality-warping
3. **Stain Track**: Corruption from forbidden techniques, soul-damaging powers, principle violations

**When you mark a cost track**, you gain power now but face consequences later:
- **At 5 marks**: Minor penalties begin
- **At 10 marks**: Significant complications emerge
- **At 15 marks**: Major narrative consequences
- **At 20+ marks**: Campaign-defining events

**Cost tracks can be reduced** through narrative actions (redemption arcs, sacrifices, spiritual cleansing).

## 0.4 Key Terminology

### Character Statistics

**Primary Stats (9 total)**:
- **Soul Cluster**: Essence, Resolve, Presence
- **Body Cluster**: Strength, Endurance, Agility
- **Mind Cluster**: Technique, Willpower, Focus
- Range: -1 to +11
- Purchased with Power Points (PP) during character creation

**Core Stats (3 total)**:
- **Body Core**, **Mind Core**, **Soul Core**
- Automatically derived (average of their cluster's Primary Stats)
- Used for defenses and resistance checks

**Aether Stats (3 total)**:
- **Control**, **Fate**, **Spirit**
- High-tier cultivation stats
- Purchased separately with PP
- Used for supernatural effects and Soul Level calculation

### Progression Terms

**SCL (Soul Core Level)**:
- Main balance cap
- Formula: `SCL = CL + SL`
- Determines power band

**CL (Core Level)**:
- Material refinement level
- Formula: `CL = floor((Body Core + Mind Core + Soul Core) / 3)`
- Represents how "hardened" your physical and mental foundation is

**SL (Soul Level)**:
- Spiritual awakening level
- Formula: `SL = floor((Control + Fate + Spirit) / 3)`
- Represents how "awake" your soul is

**Sequence**:
- In-world cultivation tier label
- Approximately equal to SCL
- Examples: "Low-Sequence Cultivator", "High-Sequence Immortal"

### Combat Terms

**Pillar**:
- Conflict type (Violence, Influence, or Revelation)
- Each has its own attack/defense stats

**Attack Bonus**:
- Number added to d20 when making attacks
- Combined with Effect Rank, must not exceed caps

**Effect Rank**:
- Power/difficulty of your technique
- Target rolls resistance vs. DC 10 + Effect Rank

**Defense**:
- Target number for enemy attacks
- Combines dodge/parry with defensive abilities

**Resilience**:
- "Soak" or durability
- Rolled vs. DC 10 + Effect Rank to resist conditions

**Technique**:
- Special ability or power (like "spells" or "abilities")
- Costs AE to activate
- Has Attack Bonus and Effect Rank

**Quick Action**:
- Low-impact tactical action (Strike, Block, Pressure, etc.)
- Taken in Stages 1 or 3 of advanced combat
- Does not cost AE

**Major Action**:
- Technique use or complex maneuver
- Taken in Stage 2 of combat
- Usually costs AE

### Advancement Terms

**PP (Power Points)**:
- Character creation currency
- Spent to buy stats, techniques, and abilities

**XP (Experience Points)**:
- Optional advancement currency
- Earned during play, spent on improvements

**Breakthrough**:
- Moment of cultivation advancement
- Increases SCL, may trigger tribulations
- Major narrative milestone

**Tribulation**:
- Challenge faced during breakthrough
- Heaven Tribulation (Violence), Dao Heart Tribulation (Revelation), Karmic Tribulation (Influence)

## 0.5 Design Philosophy

### "Power Draws Blood"

**Core principle**: Optimization and specialization come with mechanical costs.

You can build a glass cannon (high attack, low defense), but you'll mark your **Blood Track** and face consequences. You can manipulate fate for guaranteed success, but you'll mark your **Fate Track** and owe the universe. You can use forbidden demonic techniques for massive power, but you'll mark your **Stain Track** and risk corruption.

**This creates meaningful choices**. No "strictly better" build exists - every path has trade-offs.

### Simple and Fast at the Table

**Complex character builds, streamlined play.**

- **Character creation**: Many options, deep customization, front-loaded complexity
- **Session play**: Roll d20, compare to DC, done. Minimal per-turn calculations.
- **GM prep**: Templates and guidelines for quick encounter creation

We want the depth of M&M 3e character building without the table-time complexity.

### Three Pillars Are Equal

**Violence, Influence, and Revelation are mechanically equivalent.**

A social manipulator is as mechanically viable as a martial artist or an eldritch horror cultist. Each conflict type:
- Has its own attack/defense stats
- Uses the same resolution mechanics
- Has 4-step condition ladders
- Can take out opponents at 4th degree

**This supports diverse party compositions and play styles.**

### Fiction-First

**Mechanics support narrative, don't replace it.**

If a technique description says "summon a blade of pure void", that's not just flavor - it's void-element, can cut incorporeal beings, etc. Work with your GM to apply narrative implications mechanically.

Conversely, don't mechanically optimize without narrative justification. A "Sword Saint" shouldn't have social manipulation as their primary pillar without story explanation.

### Xianxia Flavor Is Essential

**This is not generic fantasy.**

Cultivation progression, sect politics, tribulations, heavenly treasures, and cosmic scale are core to the setting. Mechanically, this manifests as:
- SCL progression through breakthroughs (not gradual XP accumulation)
- Cost tracks reflecting cultivation's dangers
- Three-pillar system supporting Xianxia conflict types (martial duels, political intrigue, spiritual corruption)
- Sequence bands matching cultivation tiers from genre fiction

# Section 1: Character Creation

## 1.1 Character Creation Overview

Creating a WUXUXIANXIA character is a **10-step process**:

**Step 1**: Choose concept and cultivation path
**Step 2**: Determine starting SCL and Power Point (PP) budget
**Step 3**: Purchase Primary Stats (9 stats)
**Step 4**: Purchase Aether Stats (3 stats)
**Step 5**: Calculate derived stats (Core Stats, CL, SL, SCL)
**Step 6**: Choose Power Profile per pillar (Balanced/Blood-Forward/Ward-Forward)
**Step 7**: Distribute offense/defense bands per pillar
**Step 8**: Calculate combat resources (THP, AE, Strain max, Guard mechanics)
**Step 9**: Select techniques and effects
**Step 10**: Choose starting equipment and finalize background

**Expected time**: 1-2 hours for first character, 30-45 minutes for experienced players.

**GM Guidance**: For new players, start with a pre-generated character or use a Playbook (Section 1.5) to speed up the process.

---

## 1.2 Power Point Budget by SCL

Characters are built using **Power Points (PP)**. Your starting PP depends on your starting SCL.

### Standard Starting SCL: 5 (Mid-Sequence)

**Recommended for most campaigns.** Represents professional cultivators - competent but not legendary.

### PP Budget Table

| Starting SCL | Total PP | Typical Tier |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | 15 PP | Tutorial/cursed start |
| 2 | 30 PP | Rookie cultivator |
| 3 | 45 PP | Street-level hero |
| 4 | 60 PP | Experienced adept |
| **5** | **75 PP** | **Professional (Recommended)** |
| 6 | 90 PP | Elite operative |
| 7 | 105 PP | City-level threat |
| 8 | 135 PP | National hero |
| 9 | 165 PP | Demigod |
| 10 | 195 PP | Ascended immortal |
| 11+ | 225+ PP | Transcendent being |

**Note**: These are **baselines**. GMs may adjust PP budgets for specific campaign tones (high-power heroic, low-power gritty, etc.).

### Spending PP

PP is spent on:
- **Primary Stats**: 1 PP per rank (typically 2 PP per rank at creation)
- **Aether Stats**: 2 PP per rank (higher cost reflects their power)
- **Techniques**: Variable (1-10 PP depending on effect and rank)
- **Equipment**: 1-5 PP for significant items
- **Advantages**: 1 PP per advantage (special traits, resources, etc.)

**Unspent PP**: You don't have to spend all PP at creation. Saving 5-10 PP gives flexibility during early sessions.

---

## 1.3 Starting Cultivation Stage

Your starting SCL determines your **Sequence band** - the in-world cultivation tier.

### Sequence Bands

| Sequence Band | SCL Range | Description | Power Scope |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cursed-Sequence** | 1-2 | Collapsing souls, cursed mortals, broken powers. Often start of tragic backstories or hard-mode campaigns. | Personal survival, recovering from calamity |
| **Low-Sequence** | 3-4 | Street-level empowered, unstable rookies. Just entered cultivation world. | Block/neighborhood, small threats |
| **Mid-Sequence** | 5-7 | Professional operatives, city-level threats. Competent and respected. **Default starting range.** | City/region, significant conflicts |
| **High-Sequence** | 8-10 | National heroes, demigods, angels, saints. Names known across nations. | Nation/continent, world-shaking events |
| **Transcendent** | 11+ | Great Old Ones, True Gods, cosmic entities. Beyond mortal scales. | Multiverse, reality-altering |

### Sequence Naming Conventions

In-world, cultivators refer to Sequence numerically in reverse (higher number = weaker):
- Sequence 10-11: Lowest tier (Cursed)
- Sequence 9-8: Low tier
- Sequence 7-5: Mid tier (most PCs)
- Sequence 4-1: High tier (late-game PCs, major NPCs)
- Sequence 0 or beyond: Transcendent (campaign-ending threats/goals)

**Mechanical vs. Narrative**: Mechanically, we use SCL (1-11+). Narratively, use Sequence rank (reverse numbering). This mirrors Xianxia convention where "Sequence 9" is weakest.

---

## 1.4 Concept and Path Selection

### Step 1A: Character Concept

Write a **one-sentence concept** that captures your character's core identity:

**Examples**:
- "Disgraced sect disciple seeking redemption through forbidden sword arts"
- "Body refiner obsessed with perfecting the ultimate physical form"
- "Spirit channeler haunted by visions of the future"
- "Political manipulator using shadow techniques to control sects from behind"
- "Beast sovereign bonded to an ancient dragon spirit"

**Concept serves three purposes**:
1. Guides stat and technique selection
2. Provides roleplaying direction
3. Creates narrative hooks for GM

### Step 1B: Cultivation Path

Choose a **cultivation path** that defines your approach to power:

#### Orthodox Cultivation
- **Method**: Traditional sect teachings, gradual refinement
- **Advantages**: Steady progression, no inherent corruption risk, strong support network
- **Disadvantages**: Slower advancement, rigid rules, political entanglements
- **Best For**: Team players, those wanting stable advancement

#### Demonic Cultivation
- **Method**: Fast power through dark techniques, soul consumption
- **Advantages**: Rapid advancement, powerful forbidden techniques
- **Disadvantages**: Marks Stain Track frequently, hunted by orthodox sects, corruption risk
- **Best For**: Glass cannons, those willing to pay costs

#### Celestial Cultivation
- **Method**: Divine/angelic powers, harmony with heaven
- **Advantages**: Slow but pure (reduced cost track marking), heaven's favor
- **Disadvantages**: Very slow advancement, strict moral code, vulnerable to corruption
- **Best For**: Paladins, healers, those wanting "clean" power

#### Natural Cultivation
- **Method**: Harmony with environment, spiritual beasts, elemental forces
- **Advantages**: Environment-dependent bonuses, spirit beast companions, flexible
- **Disadvantages**: Weaker in unnatural environments, slower in cities
- **Best For**: Druids, rangers, beast masters

#### Artifice Cultivation
- **Method**: Technology + cultivation hybrid, arrays, formations
- **Advantages**: Can craft equipment, preparation-based power, scalable
- **Disadvantages**: Requires resources/prep time, weaker without equipment
- **Best For**: Crafters, tacticians, prep-time specialists

**Mechanical Impact**: Cultivation path primarily affects:
- Which techniques are available
- Cost track marking rates
- Advancement speed
- Social interactions with sects/factions

### Step 1C: Background

Answer these questions to flesh out your character:

1. **Where do you come from?** (Sect, clan, rogue, city, wilderness)
2. **What drives you?** (Power, revenge, knowledge, protection, ascension)
3. **What do you fear losing?** (Loved ones, humanity, reputation, life)
4. **Who are your enemies?** (Rival cultivator, sect elder, demon, past self)
5. **What is your cultivation goal?** (Ascension, revenge, protection, understanding)

**GM Note**: Use background answers to create personalized story hooks and tribulations.

## 1.5 Playbooks (Optional Starting Templates)

For faster character creation, choose a **Playbook** - a pre-configured template that provides:
- Recommended stat distribution
- Starting techniques
- Power profile suggestions
- Cultivation path recommendation
- Advancement milestones

**Note**: Playbooks are starting points, not restrictions. Customize freely.

### Playbook: Sword Saint

**Concept**: Weapon specialist focused on perfecting technique
**Path**: Orthodox Cultivation
**Primary Pillar**: Violence

**Recommended Stats** (SCL 5, 75 PP):
- **Soul**: Essence 3, Resolve 5, Presence 3
- **Body**: Strength 5, Endurance 4, Agility 6
- **Mind**: Technique 7, Willpower 4, Focus 5
- **Aether**: Control 4, Fate 2, Spirit 2

**Result**: CL = 5, SL = 3, SCL = 8... wait, that's too high. Let me recalculate.

Actually, let me fix this:
- **Body Core** = (5+4+6)/3 = 5
- **Mind Core** = (7+4+5)/3 = 5.33 → 5
- **Soul Core** = (3+5+3)/3 = 3.67 → 4
- **CL** = (5+5+4)/3 = 4.67 → 5
- **SL** = (4+2+2)/3 = 2.67 → 3
- **SCL** = 5 + 3 = 8

Hmm, that's SCL 8, not SCL 5. Let me adjust:

**Corrected Recommended Stats** (for SCL 5):
- **Soul**: Essence 2, Resolve 3, Presence 2
- **Body**: Strength 4, Endurance 3, Agility 5
- **Mind**: Technique 5, Willpower 3, Focus 4
- **Aether**: Control 2, Fate 1, Spirit 2

**Calculation**:
- Body Core = (4+3+5)/3 = 4
- Mind Core = (5+3+4)/3 = 4
- Soul Core = (2+3+2)/3 = 2.33 → 2
- CL = (4+4+2)/3 = 3.33 → 3
- SL = (2+1+2)/3 = 1.67 → 2

## 1.6 Choosing a Playbook vs. Custom Creation

**Use a Playbook if**:
- This is your first WUXUXIANXIA character
- You want to start playing quickly (15-20 minutes)
- You're learning the system and want a "working" build
- You like the archetype and want minor customization

**Create Custom if**:
- You have a specific character concept not covered by playbooks
- You're experienced with the system
- You want complete control over stats and techniques
- You're optimizing for a specific strategy

**Hybrid Approach**: Start with a playbook, then tweak stats and techniques to match your concept. This is the recommended approach for most players.

## 2.2 Core Stats (3 Derived Stats)

Core Stats are **not purchased** - they are automatically calculated from your Primary Stats.

### Calculation Formula

**Body Core** = round((Strength + Endurance + Agility) / 3)
**Mind Core** = round((Technique + Willpower + Focus) / 3)
**Soul Core** = round((Essence + Resolve + Presence) / 3)

**Rounding**: Standard rounding (0.5 and above rounds up, below 0.5 rounds down)

**Example**:
- Strength 4, Endurance 3, Agility 5
- Body Core = (4 + 3 + 5) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

**Example with rounding**:
- Essence 3, Resolve 4, Presence 3
- Soul Core = (3 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33... → rounds to 3

### Uses of Core Stats

Core Stats are used for:
1. **Defense calculations** (Body Core → Body Defense, etc.)
2. **Resistance checks** (Body Core → Body Resilience, etc.)
3. **Core Level (CL) calculation** (average of all three Core Stats)

**Design Note**: By deriving Core Stats instead of purchasing them, we avoid "paying twice" for the same capability - a common criticism of M&M 3e's ability + defense cost structure.

## 2.3 Aether Stats (3 Purchased Stats)

Aether Stats represent **high-tier cultivation abilities** - supernatural capacities beyond normal physical/mental/spiritual attributes.

### Stat Range and Cost

**Range**: -1 to +11 (same as Primary Stats)

**Cost**: 
- **At Character Creation**: 3 PP per rank (higher than Primary Stats)
- **After Creation**: 5 PP per rank (advancement)

**Why higher cost?** Aether Stats scale into late-game power and determine Soul Level, making them extremely valuable.

### The Three Aether Stats

#### Control
**What it represents**: Command over power output, stability at high ranks, precision in energy channeling

**Used for**:
- Preventing power leakage (reduced collateral damage)
- Maintaining sustained techniques
- Resisting backlash from forbidden techniques
- Fine manipulation of complex effects

**High Control examples**: Can channel devastating power safely through allies, techniques have surgical precision, no wasted energy

**Low Control examples**: Powers flare uncontrollably, damages surroundings, techniques fizzle or explode, can't sustain complex effects

**Who needs high Control**: Glass cannons, late-game characters, anyone using area effects near allies

#### Fate
**What it represents**: Destiny entanglement, luck, story weight, karmic connections

**Used for**:
- Luck manipulation techniques
- Rerolls and probability alteration
- Karmic links and bonds
- Plot armor (literally)

**High Fate examples**: Survives "certain death" through coincidence, finds treasures in ruins, enemies' attacks miss at critical moments

**Low Fate examples**: Unlucky, suffers consequences of actions immediately, no "lucky breaks", karma catches up quickly

**Who needs high Fate**: Social manipulators, gamblers, anyone wanting narrative protection, "chosen one" archetypes

#### Spirit
**What it represents**: Spiritual potency, connection to higher realms, capacity to channel celestial/cursed energies

**Used for**:
- Summoning entities
- Communicating with spirits
- Celestial/demonic techniques
- Resisting spiritual corruption

**High Spirit examples**: Channels divine/demonic power safely, sees and communicates with spirits freely, attracts supernatural allies

**Low Spirit examples**: Blind to spirits, cannot use celestial/cursed techniques, vulnerable to possession, spiritual attacks hit hard

**Who needs high Spirit**: Summoners, celestial cultivators, demonic cultivators, anyone dealing with spirits/gods/demons

### Aether Stat Synergies

**Control + Fate**: Precise luck manipulation (surgically alter probability)
**Control + Spirit**: Stable summoning/channeling (summons obey perfectly)
**Fate + Spirit**: Destiny-based summoning (summon what you "need", not what you call)
**All Three High**: Late-game powerhouse, transcendent beings

## 2.4 Soul Core Level (SCL) Calculation

SCL is your **main power cap** - the hidden number that determines what you can achieve.

### The Formula

**Step 1**: Calculate Core Level (CL)
```
CL = floor((Body Core + Mind Core + Soul Core) / 3)
```

**Step 2**: Calculate Soul Level (SL)
```
SL = floor((Control + Fate + Spirit) / 3)
```

**Step 3**: Calculate SCL
```
SCL = CL + SL
```

**Flooring**: Always round down (3.99 → 3).

### Detailed Example

**Character**: "Crimson Blade", Sword Saint

**Primary Stats**:
- Strength 4, Endurance 3, Agility 5 → Body Core = (4+3+5)/3 = 4
- Technique 5, Willpower 3, Focus 4 → Mind Core = (5+3+4)/3 = 4
- Essence 2, Resolve 3, Presence 2 → Soul Core = (2+3+2)/3 = 2.33 → 2

**Aether Stats**:
- Control 2, Fate 1, Spirit 2 → SL = (2+1+2)/3 = 1.67 → 1

**Core Level**:
CL = (Body Core 4 + Mind Core 4 + Soul Core 2) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33 → 3

**Soul Level**:
SL = 1 (from above)

**SCL**:
SCL = CL 3 + SL 1 = **4**

**Result**: Crimson Blade is SCL 4 (Low-Sequence cultivator).

### What SCL Determines

**Balance Caps** (per conflict pillar):
- Attack Bonus + Effect Rank ≤ 2 × SCL
- Defense + Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL
- Individual stats ≤ SCL + 2

**For Crimson Blade (SCL 4)**:
- Max Attack + Effect = 8 (per pillar)
- Max Defense + Resilience = 8 (per pillar)
- Individual caps = 6 (e.g., Attack Bonus ≤ 6, Effect Rank ≤ 6)

**Narrative Tier**: SCL 4 = Low-Sequence = Street-level cultivator, still learning the ropes

---

## 2.5 Sequence Rank and Narrative Tier

Your SCL determines your **Sequence Rank** - the in-world cultivation stage.

### Sequence Band Table

| Sequence Band | SCL Range | Power Scope | Typical Threats | Campaign Role |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Cursed-Sequence** | 1-2 | Personal survival | Mortal thugs, weak spirits, cursed objects | Starting point for hard-mode campaigns or tragic backstories |
| **Low-Sequence** | 3-4 | Block/neighborhood | Gang leaders, rogue cultivators, minor demons | Early-campaign PCs, first adversaries |
| **Mid-Sequence** | 5-7 | City/region | Sect elders, city lords, powerful beasts, local tyrants | Default starting PCs, main campaign range |
| **High-Sequence** | 8-10 | Nation/continent | Sect patriarchs, national heroes, demigods, angels | Late-campaign PCs, major antagonists |
| **Transcendent** | 11+ | Multiverse/cosmic | True Gods, Great Old Ones, cosmic entities, reality warpers | Campaign-ending threats or ascended PCs |

### In-World Sequence Naming

**Mechanical**: We use SCL 1-11+
**Narrative**: In-world characters use reverse numbering

**Examples**:
- SCL 3 = "Sequence 9 Cultivator" (Low-Sequence)
- SCL 5 = "Sequence 7 Cultivator" (Mid-Sequence)
- SCL 8 = "Sequence 4 Cultivator" (High-Sequence)
- SCL 11 = "Sequence 1 Cultivator" or "Beyond Sequence" (Transcendent)

**Why reverse?** Matches Xianxia genre convention (Lord of Mysteries, Reverend Insanity, etc.) where "Sequence 9" is weakest and "Sequence 0" is godhood.

**At the table**: Use whichever is clearer. Most players find "SCL 5" easier, but "Sequence 7" sounds cooler for roleplay.

### Breakthrough Thresholds

Advancing SCL requires **cultivation breakthroughs** - major narrative milestones:

**Low → Mid (SCL 4 → 5)**: "Foundation Establishment" - First major breakthrough, solidify your core
**Mid → High (SCL 7 → 8)**: "Nascent Soul Formation" - Project your will, approach divinity
**High → Transcendent (SCL 10 → 11)**: "Ascension Tribulation" - Face heaven itself, become more than mortal

Each breakthrough is a **major story event** with its own challenges (tribulations).

## 2.6 Balance Caps and Power Profiles

SCL enforces **power caps** to maintain balance. However, you can shift these caps by choosing a **Power Profile** for each conflict pillar.

### Standard Balance Caps

**Per Pillar (Violence, Influence, Revelation)**:

**Offense Band**:
- Attack Bonus + Effect Rank ≤ 2 × SCL
- Individual caps: Attack Bonus ≤ SCL + 2, Effect Rank ≤ SCL + 2

**Defense Band**:
- Defense + Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL
- Individual caps: Defense ≤ SCL + 2, Resilience ≤ SCL + 2

**Example (SCL 5)**:
- Max Attack + Effect = 10 (could be Attack 5 + Effect 5, or Attack 7 + Effect 3, etc.)
- Max Defense + Resilience = 10 (could be Defense 6 + Resilience 4, or Defense 5 + Resilience 5, etc.)
- Individual caps = 7 (no single stat above 7)

### Power Profiles (Build-Time Choice)

For **each pillar**, choose ONE profile:

#### Balanced Profile
- **Offense**: Attack + Effect ≤ 2 × SCL
- **Defense**: Defense + Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL
- **Cost Track**: No penalties
- **Best For**: Well-rounded characters, new players

#### Blood-Forward Profile (Glass Cannon)
- **Offense**: Attack + Effect ≤ 2 × SCL **+ 2**
- **Defense**: Defense + Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL **- 2**
- **Cost Track**: Mark **Blood Track** when taking 4th degree condition in this pillar
- **Best For**: High-damage specialists, ranged attackers, hit-and-run tactics

#### Ward-Forward Profile (Bulwark)
- **Defense**: Defense + Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL **+ 2**
- **Offense**: Attack + Offense ≤ 2 × SCL **- 2**
- **Cost Track**: Mark **Blood Track** when dealing 4th degree condition in this pillar (struggling to harm others)
- **Best For**: Tanks, defenders, support characters

**Important**: Power Profiles are **per pillar**, not character-wide. You could be:
- Blood-Forward Violence (glass cannon fighter)
- Balanced Influence (normal social)
- Low Revelation (weak against horror)

### Within-Band Trade-Offs

Within your offense or defense band, you can trade +2 for -2:

**Offense Trade-Offs**:
- **Accuracy-Leaning**: +2 Attack Bonus, -2 Effect Rank (hit more often, less impact)
- **Power-Leaning**: +2 Effect Rank, -2 Attack Bonus (hit less often, more impact)

**Defense Trade-Offs**:
- **Evasion-Leaning**: +2 Defense, -2 Resilience (dodge more, hurt more when hit)
- **Toughness-Leaning**: +2 Resilience, -2 Defense (get hit more, hurt less when hit)

**Example (SCL 5, Balanced Violence)**:
- Standard: Attack 5 + Effect 5 = 10
- Accuracy-Leaning: Attack 7 + Effect 3 = 10 (still within cap)
- Power-Leaning: Attack 3 + Effect 7 = 10 (still within cap)

### Omni-Defensive Restriction

To prevent "untouchable" characters:

**Rule**: Only ONE pillar can be at full defense cap (2 × SCL). At least one other pillar must be ≤ 1.5 × SCL defense.

**Example (SCL 5)**:
- Violence Defense: 10 (full cap)
- Influence Defense: 7 (reduced, 1.4 × SCL)
- Revelation Defense: 10 (full cap) ← NOT ALLOWED

**Allowed configurations**:
- Two pillars at full, one low
- One pillar at full, two moderate
- All three moderate

**Reasoning**: Every character should have at least one exploitable weakness. No "immune to everything" builds.
