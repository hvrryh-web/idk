I’ve put together the structures you asked for and generated spreadsheets you can download and edit.

## **1\) Effects & Playbooks – Excel Workbook**

I created an Excel file with multiple tabs that organize the core effects, extras/flaws, and 40 playbooks by lean.

**Download:**  
 SoulCore\_Effects\_and\_Playbooks.xlsx

### **Tabs inside this workbook**

1. **Effects**  
    Columns:

   * Effect

   * Rule Summary

   * Balance Tag

2. Contains the trimmed list:

   * Strike

   * Debilitate

   * Drain

   * Push/Pull

   * Flight

   * Dash

   * Teleport

   * Armor/Wards

   * Guard

   * Barrier

   * Narrow Immunity

   * Enhanced Senses

   * Mind Pierce

   * Glamour/Veil

   * Blessing/Hex

3. These match the write-ups we did: each is a core effect that will get detailed rule text in your main rules document (action type, roll, resistance, degrees → conditions, etc.). You can now add full paragraphs under “Rule Summary” or split into additional columns as needed (Action, Target, Roll, Save, Degrees, Cost, Notes, etc.).

4. **Extras\_Flaws**  
    Columns:

   * Name

   * Description

   * Type (Extra / Flaw)

5. Entries (ready to expand into full rules text):

   * Accurate – \+2 Attack, counts as \+1 rank for Offense band (Extra)

   * Powerful – \+2 DC, counts as \+1 rank for Offense band (Extra)

   * Area (Burst/Line/Cone) – Multitarget, Offense rank capped by SCL (Extra)

   * Selective – Area spares allies (Extra)

   * Precise – Fine control, surgical targeting (Extra)

   * Limited – Only works under certain conditions (Flaw)

   * Tiring – Marks Blood/Fate/Stain when used (Flaw)

   * Slow – Longer action or extended activation (Flaw)

   * Unreliable – Limited uses or misfire risk (Flaw)

6. You can add columns for “Cost Adjustment” (+1/rank, −1/rank, \+Flat, −Flat) and “Recommended Pillars” for each Extra/Flaw.

7. **Playbooks\_Body**  
    Ten Body-lean archetypes (Violence pillar focus), columns:

   * Playbook Name

   * Theme/Concept

   * Primary Lean

   * SCL Band

   * CL/SL Emphasis

   * Violence Profile (Balanced / Blood-Forward / Ward-Forward)

   * Influence Profile

   * Revelation Profile

   * Signature Effects

   * Primary Cost Track Hooks

8. Examples included:

   * Gu-Swarm Enforcer

   * Bone-Breaker Boxer

   * Heavenly Spear

   * Cursed Blade Ronin

   * Titanic Warder

   * Sequence Butcher

   * Urban Juggernaut

   * Gu-Blood Berserker

   * Anchor Knight

   * Battlefield Conductor

9. **Playbooks\_Soul**  
    Ten Soul-lean archetypes (Influence pillar focus):

   * Media Oracle

   * Cursed Politician

   * Cult Shepherd

   * Heaven-Marked Saint

   * Spin Doctor

   * Social Gu Broker

   * Ruinous Idol

   * Court Inquisitor

   * Patron Demon

   * Civic Gu Architect

10. **Playbooks\_Mind**  
     Ten Mind-lean archetypes (Revelation pillar focus):

    * Occult Investigator

    * Gu Scholar

    * Doomed Prophet

    * Dream Hacker

    * Sanity Surgeon

    * Archivist of the End

    * Media Data Diver

    * Psychic Interlocutor

    * Sequence Auditor

    * Gu-Sanity Priest

11. **Playbooks\_Hybrid**  
     Ten hybrid/balanced archetypes, including a high-Seq “Angel of Ratings” as your **playable High-Sequence example**:

    * Gu Paladin

    * Shadow Broker

    * Heavenly Sniper

    * Media Exorcist

    * Sequence Marshal

    * Divine Regulator

    * Cursed Reporter

    * Urban Saint

    * Abyssal Duelist

    * Angel of Ratings (High-Seq example playbook)

Each playbook row already encodes:

* Pillar lean(s)

* SCL band

* CL/SL emphasis

* Power Draws Blood profile per pillar

* Signature effects (mapped to the Effects tab)

* Which cost tracks they lean on (Blood, Fate, Stain)

You can now flesh these out into full 1–2 page spreads per playbook in your rulebook while using the sheet as your mechanical skeleton.

## **2\) Boss Design – Excel Workbook**

I also created a second Excel file for boss design, scaling, and NPC roles.

**Download:**  
 SoulCore\_Boss\_Design.xlsx

### **Tabs inside this workbook**

1. **Boss\_Tiers**  
    Columns:

   * Boss Rank

   * Strength Guideline

   * SCL / Design Notes

2. Entries (summary):

   * **Rank 1 Boss**

     * 100–150% of 3-PC party strength.

     * Simple, single-stage boss.

     * SCL parity or \+1; minor band bonuses.

   * **Rank 2 Boss**

     * 150–200% of 3-PC party strength.

     * Adds minions or an environmental hazard.

     * SCL parity or \+2; one pillar might have a \+2 band over PCs.

   * **Rank 3 Boss**

     * 200–250% of 3-PC party strength.

     * Major mechanics; possible small transformation or resilience spike mid-fight.

     * SCL \+2–3; strong pillar focus.

   * **Rank 4 Boss**

     * 300–350% of 3-PC party strength.

     * At least one extra boss stage (resurrects/transforms/phase change).

     * SCL \+3–4; two-stage fight; explicit interactions with Blood/Fate/Stain.

   * **Rank 5 Nemesis**

     * Up to 350%+ of 3-PC party strength.

     * Rival nemesis with 1–2 extra stages and full narrative investment.

     * SCL \+4+; multi-stage; deeply tied to PCs’ Fate and Stain tracks.

You can add columns here for “Recommended Number of Minions/Elites”, “Boss Fury/Clout/Insight Pools”, and “Boss Cost-Track Behaviours” (how they mark Blood/Fate/Stain and how those change stages).

2. **Minions\_Elites**  
    Columns:

   * Type

   * Role & Strength

   * SCL / Design Notes

3. Entries:

   * **Minion**

     * \~50–75% of a PC’s effective strength.

     * Simple statblock; often drop in 1–2 solid hits.

     * SCL −1 to 0 relative to PCs; limited bands.

   * **Elite**

     * \~100–150% of a PC’s effective strength.

     * Tougher than minions; bridge between PCs and bosses.

     * SCL parity or \+1; one pillar advanced.

4. **SCL\_Scaling**  
    Columns:

   * SCL

   * Offense Band Ref

   * Defense Band Ref

   * Boss Rank 1 Multiplier

   * Boss Rank 3 Multiplier

   * Boss Rank 5 Multiplier

5. For SCL 4–12, this provides:

   * A reference Offense/Defense band (2 × SCL).

   * A rough multiplier for a Rank 1 boss, Rank 3 boss, and Rank 5 boss relative to a single PC’s “baseline strength”.

6. Example rows (you’ll see the exact numbers in the sheet):

   * At **SCL 4**:

     * Offense Band Ref: 8

     * Defense Band Ref: 8

     * Boss Rank 1 Multiplier: \~1.0× PC

     * Boss Rank 3 Multiplier: \~1.5× PC

     * Boss Rank 5 Multiplier: \~3.0× PC

   * At **SCL 8**:

     * Offense Band Ref: 16

     * Defense Band Ref: 16

     * Boss Rank 1 Multiplier: \~1.2× PC

     * Boss Rank 3 Multiplier: \~1.7× PC

     * Boss Rank 5 Multiplier: \~3.4× PC

You can refine these multipliers to hit your desired “150–350% of 3-PC party” feel, but the table gives you a starting skeleton to tune.

## **How to Use These with Your Rulebook**

1. **Effects & Extras/Flaws → Full Rules Text (Word/Docs)**

   * Copy the **Effects** tab into your main rules document.

   * For each effect, expand “Rule Summary” into structured rule text:

     * Action Type (Standard/Move/Reaction/Extended)

     * Target (Single / Area)

     * Attack Roll (Pillar and stat)

     * Resistance Roll (Defense/Resilience and pillar)

     * Degrees → Conditions mapping

     * How Fury/Clout/Insight and Blood/Fate/Stain may apply

     * Recommended Extras/Flaws from the Extras\_Flaws tab

   * Do the same for Extras/Flaws: give each one a 1–3 line crunch block plus examples.

2. **Playbooks → Character Creation Chapter**

   * Each row in the playbook tabs becomes:

     * One “Playbook” page with:

       * Flavour blurb

       * Starting SCL band and CL/SL emphasis

       * Pillar Power Draws Blood profiles

       * Recommended stat spreads

       * Signature effects and how they hook into Fury/Clout/Insight \+ cost tracks

   * You can further add columns in the sheet for:

     * “Starting PP”

     * “Recommended Primary Stats”

     * “Unique Moves/Abilities”

3. **Boss Design Workbook → GM Chapter**

   * Use **Boss\_Tiers** as your template for a GM section like “Designing Bosses by Rank”.

   * Use **Minions\_Elites** to create procedural guidance for encounter building:

     * Example: “Rank 3 boss \+ 2 elites \+ 4 minions is an ‘epic fight’ for a 3-PC party at SCL 7–8.”

   * Use **SCL\_Scaling** to keep numerical bands aligned with your SCL math.

---

If you’d like next, I can:

* Draft **page-ready rule text** for 2–3 of the core effects \+ their Extras/Flaws as a pattern, or

* Turn a subset of these playbooks (e.g., 4–8) into fully written archetype pages with advancement hooks, or

* Write the **GM-facing boss design procedure** step-by-step using the Boss\_Design workbook as the backbone.
