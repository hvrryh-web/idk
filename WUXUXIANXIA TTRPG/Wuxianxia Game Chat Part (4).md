I’ll break this into three sections:

1. Page-ready rules text for core effects \+ Extras/Flaws pattern.

2. 6 fully written archetype playbooks with advancement hooks.

3. GM-facing boss design procedure.

You can copy these directly into your draft and then tweak language to fully match your book’s voice.

---

## **1\. Page-Ready Effect Rules \+ Extras/Flaws Pattern**

I’ll do three cornerstone effects—**Strike**, **Debilitate**, and **Flight**—plus a reusable template for **Extras & Flaws**.

### **1.1 Strike (Core Damage)**

**Type:** Offensive Effect – Violence Pillar  
 **Balance Tag:** Balanced  
 **Action:** Standard  
 **Range:** Close (default)  
 **Target:** One creature or object

**Effect:**  
 You make a **Violence attack** to inflict direct physical harm.

1. Roll **d20 \+ Violence Attack** vs the target’s **Body Defense**.

2. If you hit, the target rolls **d20 \+ Body Resilience** vs DC **10 \+ Strike rank**.

3. Compare the resistance result to the DC and apply **Violence conditions** based on degrees of failure:

* Failure by 1–4: **Injured**

  * You suffer minor harm. Take a −2 circumstance penalty on further Violence actions (Violence Attack and Body Defense) until you receive short-term recovery.

* Failure by 5–9: **Maimed**

  * As Injured, and you are **Hindered** (reduced movement and impaired fine actions) until you receive serious treatment.

* Failure by 10–14: **Mortally Wounded**

  * You are taken out of the scene by your injuries. You are dying, unconscious, or otherwise unable to meaningfully act.

* Failure by 15+: **Ruined Body**

  * You suffer catastrophic harm (maimed, dismembered, or killed) as appropriate to the fiction. Undoing this requires advanced medicine, powerful techniques, or metaphysical intervention.

**Caps & Power Draws Blood:**

* Your **Strike rank \+ Violence Attack** must not exceed your **Violence Offense Band**, determined by SCL and your Power Draws Blood profile.

* If you are **Blood-Forward (Violence)**, your Violence Offense Band is 2 × SCL \+ 2; your Violence Defense Band is 2 × SCL − 2\.

* If you are **Ward-Forward (Violence)**, your Offense Band is 2 × SCL − 2; your Defense Band is 2 × SCL \+ 2\.

* A **glass cannon** will typically run Strike at high rank with slightly lower Body Defense/Resilience, while a **bulwark** inverts this.

**Meta-Currencies & Costs:**

* You may spend **Fury** to reroll a missed Strike or add \+2 to a successful hit’s DC after the roll (GM may limit this to once per target per round).

* Strike does not inherently mark **Blood**, but:

  * Using Strike in a way clearly aiming at **Ruined Body** outside of lethal stakes may mark **Stain** or **Fate**, at GM discretion.

**Common Extras & Flaws for Strike:**

* **Accurate:** This Strike is especially easy to land.

* **Powerful:** This Strike hits abnormally hard.

* **Area (Close Burst or Line):** Your Strike hits multiple foes in reach; each resists separately.

* **Tiring (Flaw):** Each use marks **Blood 1** on your track; your own body pays for the damage.

---

### **1.2 Debilitate (Affliction by Pillar)**

**Type:** Offensive Effect – Violence / Influence / Revelation  
 **Balance Tag:** Balanced → Strong  
 **Action:** Standard  
 **Range:** Close or Ranged (descriptor-dependent)  
 **Target:** One creature (Area versions exist with strict limits)

**Effect:**  
 You attack a target’s ability to function along one pillar’s track: Violence (Body), Influence (Soul), or Revelation (Mind).

1. Choose one **Debilitate track** when you acquire this power:

   * **Violence Debilitate** – physical crippling on the Violence track.

   * **Influence Debilitate** – social/political ruin on the Influence track.

   * **Revelation Debilitate** – sanity/insight collapse on the Revelation track.

2. Roll **Attack** using the pillar associated with your Debilitate (Violence, Influence, or Revelation) vs the corresponding **Defense** (Body, Soul, or Mind).

3. On a hit, the target rolls a **Resilience** check for that pillar vs DC **10 \+ Debilitate rank**.

4. Compare the result and apply conditions for that track:

**Violence Debilitate – Track:** Injured → Maimed → Mortally Wounded → Ruined Body

* As per Strike, but framed as **crippling rather than pure damage** (nerve strikes, cursed ligatures, etc.).

**Influence Debilitate – Track:** Rattled → Discredited → Isolated → Shattered/Broken

* Failure by 1–4: **Rattled**

  * −2 on social Influence actions and related defenses; you are shaken by public doubt or personal doubt.

* Failure by 5–9: **Discredited**

  * You take Rattled penalties and suffer a situational penalty when leveraging your status; allies and NPCs treat your words with suspicion or contempt.

* Failure by 10–14: **Isolated**

  * You are socially cornered: allies abandon you, channels close, you may be suspended, ousted, or rendered persona non grata.

* Failure by 15+: **Shattered/Broken**

  * You are taken out in this social/political context: publicly ruined, sidelined, or reduced to a pawn. Reversing this requires major narrative action (campaigns to rebuild your reputation, interventions from powerful sponsors, etc.).

**Revelation Debilitate – Track:** Shaken → Haunted → Deranged → Shattered/Broken

* Failure by 1–4: **Shaken**

  * −2 to Mind-based checks (investigation, perception, sanity resistance); intrusive images begin.

* Failure by 5–9: **Haunted**

  * Persistent visions, nightmares, or auditory phenomena; further Revelation attacks gain \+2 vs you until recovered.

* Failure by 10–14: **Deranged**

  * You are taken out of the current scene by panic, psychotic breaks, or catatonia, described collaboratively.

* Failure by 15+: **Shattered/Broken**

  * Your Mind/Soul is “taken out”: a fugue state, full compromise to an entity, or total existential collapse. This is a campaign-scale consequence.

**Caps & Power Draws Blood:**

* **Debilitate rank \+ pillar Attack** must respect your pillar’s Offense Band.

* Builds designed to frequently reach 3rd degree or higher at-tier are considered **Strong**:

  * They should either be capped at moderate rank or come with **Flaws** and cost hooks.

**Meta-Currencies & Costs:**

* You may spend **Fury**, **Clout**, or **Insight** (depending on pillar) to:

  * Reroll a miss,

  * Or upgrade degrees by one step (from Rattled to Discredited, etc.),

  * Once per target per scene, GM permitting.

* Debilitate effects that:

  * Intentionally aim at **Isolated / Deranged / Shattered/Broken**

  * Or are built with high rank \+ Area \+ Accurate/Powerful

  * Should normally be **Tiring** or similar:

    * Each use that inflicts **3rd or 4th degree** condition marks **Fate** (Influence) or **Stain** (Revelation) on your cost tracks.

**Common Extras & Flaws for Debilitate:**

* **Accurate:** Debilitate is easier to apply, but eats more of your Offense band.

* **Area (Cone, Burst):** Affect multiple targets; keep rank modest.

* **Tiring (Flaw):** Each serious use marks **Fate** or **Stain**, representing the toll of breaking others.

* **Limited (Flaw):** Debilitate only applies to a defined subset (e.g. “officials of X faith”, “users of Gu”).

---

### **1.3 Flight (Baseline Movement Suite)**

**Type:** Utility Effect – Movement  
 **Balance Tag:** Strong  
 **Action:** Move (sustained use) or Free (for already-active Flight)  
 **Range:** Personal

**Effect:**  
 You move through three-dimensional space with supernatural ease.

* Each rank of **Flight** grants an increasing movement speed, as defined by the movement table in your rules (e.g. rank 4 \= fast running speed, rank 8 \= high-speed aerial travel, rank 12+ \= supersonic, etc.).

* You can move vertically with no penalty and ignore most ground-based difficult terrain.

* Flight allows repositioning into superior vantage points, flanking positions, or out of reach of most melee foes.

**Caps & Power Draws Blood:**

* Flight is inherently **Strong** compared to other movement effects: it is treated as the default high-end mobility baseline.

* Your Flight rank is still subject to SCL-based **movement caps** as defined in your travel tables.

* For **Blood-Forward (Violence)** characters, Flight often combos with high offensive bands but weaker Body Resilience: if you get tagged, you *really feel it*.

**Meta-Currencies & Costs:**

* You may spend **Fury** to:

  * Negate a forced movement effect that would crash you,

  * Or reposition after being attacked (e.g. “reactive dodge and reposition”).

* Generally, Flight does not mark cost tracks by itself.

  * Exception: if Flight’s descriptor is inherently taxing (e.g. “bloodjet propulsion” or “Gu burn”), you may apply **Tiring:** each round of high-speed Flight marks **Blood**.

**Common Extras & Flaws for Flight:**

* **Precise:** Fine control; hover in place, weave through tight spaces, or dodge through small openings.

* **Limited (Only While Empowered):** Flight only works under specific conditions (e.g. in your Domain, after spending Fury, under moonlight, etc.).

* **Slow (Flaw):** You must spend a full action to accelerate; you cannot instantly reach top speed.

* **Unreliable (Flaw):** Limited uses per scene or risk of stalling on a failed roll.

---

### **1.4 Generic Extras & Flaws Pattern (For Any Effect)**

You can present Extras/Flaws in a consistent mini-block like this:

**Accurate (Extra)**

* **Effect:** Add \+2 to this effect’s Attack roll.

* **Cost:** \+1 flat PP per rank (or \+1 rank-equivalent, depending on your build model).

* **Band Impact:** Treat the effect as **\+1 rank higher** when checking Offense Band caps.

* **Notes:** Ideal for concept builds whose attacks are hard to dodge (snipers, precise cursed techniques). Overuse of Accurate can crowd out Power and creates “hit often but not hard” profiles.

**Powerful (Extra)**

* **Effect:** Increase the effect’s DC by \+2.

* **Cost:** \+1 rank-equivalent.

* **Band Impact:** Counts as \+1 rank when checking Offense Band caps.

* **Notes:** Pairs well with builds that accept lower Accuracy in exchange for crushing hits.

**Area (Extra – Burst, Line, Cone)**

* **Effect:** Affect all valid targets within a defined template. Each target resists separately.

* **Cost:** Typically \+1 rank-equivalent (tune by template and rank).

* **Band & Balance:**

  * Offense ranks for Area effects are **capped more strictly** by SCL.

  * High-rank Area \+ Powerful should be considered **Strong** and may require Tiring or Limited.

**Tiring (Flaw)**

* **Effect:** Each use of the effect marks 1 on a relevant cost track (**Blood**, **Fate**, or **Stain**, depending on descriptor).

* **Benefit:** −1 rank-equivalent cost.

* **Notes:** This is the main mechanical expression of “Power Draws Blood” at the effect level: you can push an effect’s impact or utility in exchange for deepening your long-term costs.

You can mirror this format for Limited, Slow, Unreliable, Selective, etc.

## **2\. Archetype Playbooks (6 Fully Written)**

I’ll flesh out 6: two Body-lean, two Soul-lean, one Mind-lean, and one Hybrid High-Seq example.

Each follows a consistent template: Concept, Stat & SCL targets, Profiles, Core Moves, Advancement hooks.

### **2.1 Gu-Swarm Enforcer (Body / Violence Focus)**

**Role:** Frontline striker and battlefield controller

**Concept:**  
 Your Soul Core is fused with a colony of Gu-quarks—microscopic spirit-insects that consume Qi and rewrite flesh. You are a walking swarm in human shape, specializing in brutal melee and short-range devastation.

**Recommended Band:**

* **Sequence:** Mid-Seq (5–7)

* **SCL:** 6–8

* **CL \> SL:** You are more physically trained than metaphysically refined.

**Profiles (Power Draws Blood):**

* **Violence:** Blood-Forward (glass cannon).

* **Influence:** Balanced.

* **Revelation:** Balanced.

**Suggested Stat Emphasis:**

* **Primary:** Strength, Endurance, Technique.

* **Secondary:** Essence, Resolve.

* **Aether:** Control moderate (to shape Gu), Fate/Spirit lower.

**Signature Effects:**

* **Strike (Gu Fangs):** Close Strike 8–10 with Tiring (Blood) at the high end.

* **Debilitate (Gu Ligatures – Violence):** Violence Debilitate that escalates from Injured → Ruined Body via nerve-locking Gu.

* **Push/Pull (Swarm Shove):** Forces enemies into hazards or into your allies’ kill zones.

* **Armor/Wards (Gu Shell):** Body Resilience boost flavored as hardened carapace.

**Core Playbook Moves (Examples):**

1. **Swarm Overrun**

   * When you move through an enemy’s space using Dash or high-speed Swarm movement, you may make a free low-rank Strike against them. On a hit, you may choose to mark **Blood 1** to also inflict **Injured** automatically.

2. **Hive Fortification**

   * Once per scene, you may spend **Fury 1** to rapidly harden your Gu Shell:

     * Gain \+2 Body Resilience for one round,

     * But at the end of the round, mark **Blood 1** as the Gu feed on your vitality.

3. **Predatory Surge**

   * When an enemy in melee range becomes **Maimed** or worse, you may immediately move up to half your Speed and make a Strike against another foe, representing your swarm surging over the battlefield.

**Advancement Hooks:**

* **Low Tier:**

  * Boost Strike rank and Violence Attack to sit just under your Offense Band cap.

  * Add **Accurate** to Gu Fangs OR pick up Dash to close distance reliably.

* **Mid Tier:**

  * Add a **small Area** Extra to Debilitate (Violence) or Push/Pull.

  * Unlock a move that lets you **convert Blood into Fury** once per scene (self-harm for power).

* **High Tier:**

  * Gain a limited **self-regen** technique: spend **Fury 2** and mark **Stain 1** to clear Injured/Maimed conditions by letting the Gu rebuild you.

  * Begin flirting with Revelation effects: Gu-sight, horrific Gu illusions, etc.

---

### **2.2 Titanic Warder (Body / Defensive Violence)**

**Role:** Tank, protector, anchor point

**Concept:**  
 You are a walking fortress—a body tempered to stand between allies and annihilation. Whether Gu-hardened, cybernetically enhanced, or divinely armoured, your job is to soak damage and shape enemy lines.

**Signature Effects:**

* **Armor/Wards (Titan Shell):** High Body Resilience boost; often with **Precise** to permit selective protection.

* **Guard (Interpose):** Deflect-lite effect to replace allies’ Defenses or grant them big bonuses.

* **Barrier (Bulwark):** Static cover and chokepoints.

* **Strike (Heavy Counter):** Lower rank but punishing counter-attacks.

**Core Moves:**

1. **Stand in the Storm**

   * When an ally within close range would be hit by a Violence attack, you may **swap positions** and take the hit instead.

   * If you do, you gain **Fury 1**.

2. **Immovable**

   * When forced movement would move you, you may spend Fury to reduce the distance by SCL meters (or ignore it entirely on a high roll).

   * On a success, mark **Blood 1** as your body literally absorbs the impact.

3. **Guardian’s Glare**

   * Enemies who attempt to bypass you and attack your allies suffer −2 to their Attack if they are within your melee reach, reflecting your sheer pressure.

**Advancement Hooks:**

* **Low Tier:**

  * Push Body Resilience to your Violence Defense Band limit.

  * Add **Guard** with 1–2 uses per round.

* **Mid Tier:**

  * Gain a **Barrier** technique that can be deployed as a reaction to ranged fire.

  * Learn a limited **Influence Debilitate** focused on taunts (Rattled vs you).

* **High Tier:**

  * Unlock a move that lets you **redirect conditions** from allies to you (e.g., swap Injured or Rattled conditions at cost of Blood/Fate).

---

### **2.3 Media Oracle (Soul / Influence Focus)**

**Role:** Social controller, narrative manipulator, soft battlefield control

**Concept:**  
 You read public sentiment like others read weather reports. Through Gu-infested media, divine “feeds”, or prophetic insight, you twist narrative and reputation to your advantage.

* **Sequence:** Mid-Seq (5–7)

* **SCL:** 6–8

* **SL ≥ CL.**

**Profiles:**

* **Violence:** Balanced.

* **Secondary:** Willpower, Technique.

**Signature Effects:**

* **Debilitate (Influence – Public Spin):** Social/political condition inflictor (Rattled → Shattered/Broken).

* **Glamour/Veil (Media Filter):** Illusory spin; misdirects perception and adds penalties.

* **Mind Pierce (Audience Read):** Access to what people *really* think.

* **Blessing/Hex (Viral Trend):** Long-term buff/hex affecting public opinion.

**Core Moves:**

1. **Trend Seer**

   * Once per session, ask the GM: “What outcome is the current narrative driving toward?”

   * Gain **Insight 1** and a concrete predictive statement you can exploit.

2. **Weaponized Spotlight**

   * When you successfully **Discredit** or **Isolate** a foe with Debilitate (Influence), you may spend **Clout 1** to:

     * Either also apply **Rattled** to one of their allies,

     * Or mark **Fate 1** on them and declare a new Complication tied to their damaged reputation.

3. **Viral Shield**

   * When someone attacks your reputation or a close ally’s, you may respond with a Glamour/Veil effect: on success, the attack backfires, inflicting **Rattled** on the aggressor instead.

**Advancement Hooks:**

* **Low Tier:**

  * Build mid-rank Debilitate (Influence) with Accurate, keep DC modest.

  * Invest in Enhanced Senses to read social cues and data feeds.

* **Mid Tier:**

  * Add **Area (Broadcast)** to Debilitate or Glamour to affect groups.

  * Unlock a move that lets you **trade Stain for Clout** by staging increasingly manipulative stunts.

* **High Tier:**

  * Gain a limited **“Rewrite Narrative” ritual**: with extended action and heavy Fate cost, move an NPC from “Isolated” back to “Rattled” but tie them to you.

---

### **2.4 Cursed Politician (Soul / Influence Dark Side)**

**Role:** Deal-maker, manipulator, shadow law-writer

**Concept:**  
 You thrive in back rooms and smoky chambers. Cursed Techniques sit behind your legislation, and every deal has a clause written in blood.

**Recommended Band:**

* **Sequence:** Mid–High Seq (6–8)

* **SL ≥ CL.**

**Profiles:**

* **Violence:** Balanced.

* **Influence:** Blood-Forward.

* **Revelation:** Balanced.

**Stat Emphasis:**

* **Primary:** Presence, Resolve, Technique.

* **Secondary:** Fate, Spirit.

**Signature Effects:**

* **Blessing/Hex (Contracts):** Long-term deals that grant power at a cost.

* **Debilitate (Influence – Sanction):** Penalties to standing, office, or authority.

* **Narrow Immunity (Legal Shield):** Protection against specific kinds of political attack.

**Core Moves:**

1. **Signed in Red**

   * When you Bless or Hex someone via a formal agreement, you may set a specific **trigger** which, if broken, automatically inflicts **Discredited** and marks **Fate** on them.

2. **Backroom Gu Boon**

   * Once per session, you may call in a favour from a prior Blessing/Hex: gain **Clout 2** and mark **Stain 1** for taking what was “owed” in the worst possible way.

3. **Legal Labyrinth**

   * When targeted by Influence Debilitate or similar social attacks, you may force opponents to reroll at the cost of marking **Fate 1** on yourself (you expend political capital to tangle the attack).

**Advancement Hooks:**

* **Low Tier:**

  * Moderate Blessings/Hexes with clear hooks.

  * Moderate Debilitate (Influence) used in committee and negotiation scenes.

* **Mid Tier:**

  * Add small Area or multi-target capabilities: apply clauses to entire factions.

  * Gain a move to convert **Fate into Clout** when you outmanoeuvre rivals.

* **High Tier:**

  * Acquire a dramatic **“Rewrite Law” domain**: once per season, reframe a social reality (e.g. outlaw a group) at heavy Stain/Fate cost.

---

### **2.5 Occult Investigator (Mind / Revelation Focus)**

**Role:** Investigator, forensic mystic, sanity-risk specialist

**Concept:**  
 You dive into cursed crime scenes, Gu labs, and haunted domains. Knowledge is power, even when it should have stayed buried.

**Recommended Band:**

* **Sequence:** Low–Mid Seq (4–6)

* **CL ≥ SL.**

**Profiles:**

* **Violence:** Balanced.

* **Influence:** Balanced.

* **Revelation:** Blood-Forward.

**Signature Effects:**

* **Debilitate (Revelation – Confront the Truth):** Horror-based “reveal” attacks.

* **Enhanced Senses (Forensic Sight):** See traces of magic/Qi/Gu.

* **Mind Pierce (Interrogation):** Carefully bounded mental probing.

**Core Moves:**

1. **Scene Read**

   * When you spend a few minutes examining a location, ask the GM two questions about:

     * “What happened here?”

     * “What is the most dangerous unseen thing here?”

   * Gain **Insight 1** for the scene.

2. **Shared Vision**

   * When you inflict **Haunted** or **Deranged** on a target, you may choose to share part of the vision:

     * You gain a clue or secret,

     * But must mark **Stain 1** as the revelation scars you too.

3. **Pattern Recognition**

   * When you act on information gathered through Enhanced Senses or Mind Pierce, you may spend **Insight** to gain \+2 on a relevant check or attack against the related entity/phenomenon.

**Advancement Hooks:**

* **Low Tier:**

  * Build moderate-rank Debilitate (Revelation) with Limited descriptors.

  * Enhance Investigation/Perception skill equivalents.

* **Mid Tier:**

  * Gain a move that lets you **downgrade Shaken/Haunted** in allies at the cost of **Stain or Blood**.

---

### **2.6 Angel of Ratings (Hybrid High-Seq Example Playbook)**

**Role:** High-Sequence nemesis / PC option, reality-warping media deity

**Concept:**  
 You are a celestial entity of public perception, sustained and shaped by viewership, belief, and emotional engagement. You are both god and product.

**Recommended Band:**

* **Sequence:** High Seq (9+)

* **SCL:** 10–12+

* **SL \> CL.**

**Profiles:**

* **Violence:** Balanced or Ward-Forward.

* **Influence:** Blood-Forward.

* **Revelation:** Blood-Forward.

**Stat Emphasis:**

* Elevated across the board, but with **Essence, Presence, Spirit, Fate** dominant.

**Signature Effects:**

* **Glamour/Veil (Broadcast Halo):** Large-area media illusions, framing reality like a show.

* **Debilitate (Influence/Revelation – Spectacle):** Social and psychological collapses through public humiliation and existential dread.

* **Blessing/Hex (Sponsorship):** Granting power and curses tied to “ratings”.

* **Narrow Immunity:** Immune to ordinary public opinion swings; only large, orchestrated campaigns can hurt you socially.

**Core Moves:**

1. **Ratings Spike**

   * When you orchestrate a dramatic, widely witnessed event, gain **Clout 2 and Insight 1**, but mark **Stain 1** as you become more dependent on spectacle.

2. **Season Finale**

   * Once per arc, you may declare a confrontation “Season Finale.”

   * During this scene:

     * All Debilitate (Influence/Revelation) you inflict can escalate one degree higher on a critical success,

     * But each 3rd or 4th-degree condition inflicted marks **Fate or Stain 1** on you, as the cosmic ledger tallies the cost.

3. **Renewal or Cancellation**

   * When you are reduced to **Shattered/Broken** or **Ruined Body**, you may “return next Season” by:

     * Spending accumulated **Fate and Stain** above a threshold,

     * Returning with a new form, altered playbook moves, and a changed relationship to the PCs.

**Advancement Hooks:**  
 Primarily narrative: they are as much a **living subsystem** as a character. Advancement is about:

* Changing your relationship to popularity and Stain.

* Unlocking new domain-scale effects that alter how entire arcs are structured.

---

## **3\. GM-Facing Boss Design Procedure**

Use this as a GM chapter section; it assumes the Boss\_Design workbook as a reference but does not require it at the table.

### **Step 1: Identify Party Band and Target Rank**

1. Determine the **PC party’s SCL band**:

   * Use the average SCL of the group (or standard playband like “Mid-Seq 6–8”).

2. Choose **Boss Rank** based on narrative stakes:

   * **Rank 1:** Serious but manageable episode threat (100–150% party strength).

   * **Rank 2:** Strong villain or arc opener (150–200%).

   * **Rank 3:** Major arc boss (200–250%).

   * **Rank 4:** Season Big Bad with at least one extra stage (300–350%).

   * **Rank 5 Nemesis:** Rival soul, final boss, or recurring season anchor with 1–2 extra stages (\~350%+).

Use the **Boss\_Tiers** tab as a memory aid for these guidelines.

---

### **Step 2: Set Boss SCL and Pillar Emphasis**

1. Decide Boss **SCL** relative to PCs:

   * Rank 1: SCL equal to or \+1 over PCs.

   * Rank 2: SCL parity to \+2.

   * Rank 3: SCL \+2–3.

   * Rank 4: SCL \+3–4.

   * Rank 5: SCL \+4 or more.

2. Choose **pillar emphasis**:

   * Pick **one primary pillar** where the boss is **above band** (Offense or Defense).

   * Optionally pick a **secondary pillar** where they are modestly ahead.

3. Assign **Power Draws Blood profiles**:

   * For the boss’s primary pillar, decide:

     * Glass Cannon (Blood-Forward), Bulwark (Ward-Forward), or Balanced.

   * For secondary pillars, usually Balanced.

Use the **SCL\_Scaling** tab to ensure Offense/Defense bands are correctly set.

---

### **Step 3: Define the Boss Concept and Signature Effects**

1. **Write a one-line concept:**

   * “Gu-Devouring Cult Patriarch”, “Media Angel of Ratings”, “Sequence Auditor gone rogue”, etc.

2. Based on concept and pillar emphasis, choose **3–5 signature effects** from the Effects list:

   * One or two primary offensive effects (Strike, Debilitate, Push/Pull, Revelation blasts).

   * One or two defensive/mitigation effects (Armor/Wards, Guard, Barrier, narrow Immunity).

   * One unique utility or narrative effect (Blessing/Hex, Glamour, Teleport, etc.).

3. Tune **ranks** so:

   * Primary pillar attacks/defenses sit near or at the boss’s band limits.

   * Other pillars are slightly under.

---

### **Step 4: Stage Design (for Rank 3–5 Bosses)**

For Rank 3+ bosses, design **stages**:

* **Rank 3:**

  * Usually 1.5 stages (minor mid-fight transformation).

  * At 50% condition threshold (e.g. when they become Maimed/Isolated/Haunted or lose a major asset):

    * Increase one effect’s rank,

    * Or swap one signature effect for a stronger or more dangerous variant.

* **Rank 4:**

  * **Two full stages.**

    * Stage 1: Normal form.

    * Stage 2: “Ascended” or “Desperate” form.

  * Trigger Stage 2 when:

    * A key condition hits (Mortally Wounded/Deranged),

    * Or a specific clock fills (cult almost succeeds, ratings spike, etc.).

* **Rank 5 Nemesis:**

  * **Two or three stages**:

    * Stage 1: Public persona / lesser form.

    * Stage 2: True form.

    * Optional Stage 3: Final avatar, allied with an external entity/pathway.

  * At each transition:

    * Alter **Power Draws Blood profiles** (becoming more glass cannon or more bulwark).

    * Have cost tracks (Blood/Fate/Stain) **explode** into the environment—hazards, domain shifts, revelation storms.

---

### **Step 5: Minions, Elites, and Encounter Composition**

Use the **Minions\_Elites** tab:

* **Minions:**

  * SCL −1 to parity with PCs, reduced bands, simple stat blocks.

  * Drop in 1–2 hits; used to frame the boss and create tactical pressure.

* **Elites:**

  * SCL parity to \+1 vs PCs, with one advanced pillar.

  * Function like “mini-bosses” or lieutenants.

For a 3-PC party, example encounter templates:

* **Medium Boss Fight (Rank 2):**

  * Rank 2 boss \+ 2–4 Minions

* **Hard Boss Fight (Rank 3):**

  * Rank 3 boss \+ 1–2 Elites \+ 2–4 Minions

* **Climactic Boss (Rank 4 or 5):**

  * Rank 4/5 boss (2+ stages) \+ 2–3 Elites OR environmental hazards in place of minions.

---

### **Step 6: Integrating Cost Tracks into Boss Behaviour**

Bosses should **actively interact with Blood, Fate, and Stain**:

* **Blood:**

  * Bosses may willingly mark Blood to:

    * Overclock their next attack (+2 DC),

    * Ignore the first degree of Injured/Maimed,

    * Or power a desperate self-heal.

* **Fate:**

  * Bosses can spend Fate to:

    * Call in reinforcements mid-fight,

    * Trigger a pre-planned contingency (exploding Gu nests, media smear pieces, legal traps).

* **Stain:**

  * When Stain fills for a boss:

    * They may gain a powerful, horrific new effect,

    * But also unlock vulnerabilities (e.g. their Gu become unstable, their ratings dependency makes them manipulable).

Use these structured costs to:

* Telegraph **escalation** (players see the boss paying costs),

* And give PCs multiple levers: damage them, socially erode them, or corrupt them.

### **Step 7: Example Boss Build Pass (Outline)**

For each major boss in your setting, make a **3-line mechanical snapshot**:

1. **Stats & Bands:**

   * SCL, pillar profiles, Offense/Defense band highlights.

2. **Signature Effects:**

   * Names \+ key ranks \+ key Extras/Flaws.

3. **Stage Triggers & Cost Logic:**

   * How stages change, when they trigger, and what cost tracks they hook.

Then expand into full stat blocks as needed.

If you’d like, next we can:

* Take one concrete boss (e.g. “Gu Cult Patriarch” or “Angel of Ratings”) and work up a full stat block with stages,

* Or drill down into one playbook and write its **full 2-page spread** (including sample builds, advancement trees, and in-play examples).
