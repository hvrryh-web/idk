Below is a “lock-in” pass on the next layer of the combat SRD: SCL 2 budgets \+ stat spreads, and final base costs for the five core combat effects (with Extras/Flaws) tuned against the Gu Patriarch and the three SCL 2 PCs you already have.

---

## **1\. SCL 2 SCP Budget & Suggested Stat Spreads**

### **1.1 Recap: SCL, PL-equivalent, and SCP**

We are now hard-anchoring:

* **Hidden PL ≈ 2 × SCL** for mortal-tier characters.

* **SCL 2 ⇒ hidden PL ≈ 4** (starting PCs).

* **SCL 4 ⇒ hidden PL ≈ 8** (classic “street/global hero” band).

We keep the **30 SCP per SCL** budget:

* SCL \-1: 0 SCP (pre-awakening baseline).

* SCL 0: 0 SCP.

* SCL 1: 30 SCP.

* **SCL 2: 60 SCP (starting PCs).**

* SCL 3: 90 SCP (big elites / mid-bosses).

* SCL 4: 120 SCP (hero band).

### **1.2 Trait Values (What 1 SCP Buys)**

From the prior analysis and Wuxianxia doc:

* **Core & Aether stats (Body, Mind, Soul, Control, Fate, Spirit)**

  * Cost: **2 SCP per rank**.

  * Each rank is “big”: it pushes attack \+ resilience for a pillar or expands Fury/Clout/Insight capacity.

* **Pillar-facing traits and powers**

  * **\+1 Attack** (for a specific pillar) \= 1 SCP.

  * **\+1 Defense** (Body/Mind/Soul Defense) \= 1 SCP.

  * **\+1 Resilience** (Body/Mind/Soul Resilience) \= 1 SCP.

  * **\+1 rank of a basic effect (Strike / Influence / Revelation / Ward / Debilitate)** \= 1 SCP.

* **Skills, talents, small tricks**

  * Typically **1 SCP** for a focused \+2 to a narrow set of rolls, or a small once-per-scene move.

This keeps us very close to *Mutants & Masterminds 3e*’s “1 PP \= \+1 to a focused thing or 1 rank of a basic power, 2 PP per Ability rank” philosophy, translated into SCP.

### **1.3 Recommended SCL 2 Budget Template**

**Total SCP: 60**

A good “baseline SCL 2 PC” template:

* **20 SCP – Core & Aether (10 ranks total @ 2 SCP)**

  * Enough to hit **CL \+ SL \= 2** and shape a lean.

* **20 SCP – Offense & Defense ranks**

  * Pillar-specific Attack / Defense / Resilience.

* **15 SCP – Powers (Strike / Debilitate / Ward / Influence / Revelation)**

  * 2–3 signature effects at ranks 3–5.

* **5 SCP – Skills / techniques / perks**

You can swing ±5 SCP between these buckets, but try to keep:

* **At least \~16 SCP** in Core/Aether so CL+SL really are earned by stats.

* **At least \~12 SCP** in pillar-facing offense/defense so the character actually sits near caps and feels functional in combat.

### **1.4 SCL 2 Stat Spreads (CL/SL Profiles)**

We keep:

* **CL \= ⌊(Body \+ Mind \+ Soul) / 3⌋**

* **SL \= ⌊(Control \+ Fate \+ Spirit) / 3⌋**

* **SCL \= CL \+ SL**

For SCL 2, three main profiles are useful:

#### **A. Balanced Initiate (CL 1 / SL 1\)**

You are evenly cultivated, good for generalists.

* Target sums:

  * Body \+ Mind \+ Soul ≈ 4\.

  * Control \+ Fate \+ Spirit ≈ 4\.

Example Core & Aether:

* Body 1, Mind 2, Soul 1 → (1+2+1)=4 ⇒ CL 1

* Control 1, Fate 2, Spirit 1 → (1+2+1)=4 ⇒ SL 1

* Total ranks: 8 → **16 SCP**

This leaves \~44 SCP for offense/defense, powers, skills.

Suggested pillar cap usage at SCL 2:

* Baseline band: **Attack \+ Effect ≤ 4 × SCL \= 8**, Defense \+ Resilience ≤ 8\.

* Balanced profile: OffCap 8 / DefCap 8 in all three pillars.

#### **B. Body-Lean Bruiser (CL 2 / SL 0\)**

You pushed your material cultivation; your soul/aether still lags.

* Body \+ Mind \+ Soul ≈ 7–8 → CL 2\.

* Control \+ Fate \+ Spirit ≈ 1–2 → SL 0\.

Example:

* Body 3, Mind 2, Soul 2 → (3+2+2)=7 ⇒ CL 2

* Control 1, Fate 0, Spirit 0 → (1+0+0)=1 ⇒ SL 0

* Total ranks: 8 core \+ 1 aether \= 9 → **18 SCP**

This profile:

* Hits harder and/or tanks better in **Violence**.

* Has weaker Clout/Insight pools (Fate/Spirit low).

* Still SCL 2, so **OffCap/DefCap baseline 8**, but can exploit a **Violence Blood-Forward** profile to reach OffCap 10 / DefCap 6\.

#### **C. Soul-Lean Medium (CL 1 / SL 1, Soul-heavy)**

Your Body is fragile; your presence and Fate dominate.

Example:

* Body 0, Mind 1, Soul 3 → sum=4 ⇒ CL 1

* Control 0, Fate 2, Spirit 2 → sum=4 ⇒ SL 1

* Ranks: 10 → **20 SCP**

Effects at SCL 2:

* Influence Blood-Forward:

  * **Influence OffCap 10 / DefCap 6**

  * Violence Ward-Forward: **OffCap 6 / DefCap 10**

* This mirrors the “Silk-Tongue Medium” example facing the Patriarch.

#### **D. Mind-Lean Analyst (CL 1 / SL 1, Mind-heavy)**

Example:

* Body 0, Mind 3, Soul 1 → sum=4 ⇒ CL 1

* Control 1, Fate 1, Spirit 2 → sum=4 ⇒ SL 1

* Ranks: 10 → **20 SCP**

Typical profile:

* Revelation Blood-Forward: **OffCap 10 / DefCap 6**

* Influence Ward-Forward: **OffCap 6 / DefCap 10**

* Violent Balanced: **8/8**.

These spreads are consistent with the three SCL 2 PCs already sketched against the Gu Patriarch; they all end up spending \~18–22 SCP on Core/Aether and \~38–42 on traits and powers.

## **2\. Core Combat Effects & Base Costs**

Below are the five core effects for the combat SRD, with **final base costs**, **balance tags**, and **3–5 Extras/Flaws** each. Costs are in **SCP**, and all effects assume:

* **Action:** Standard to use.

* **Roll:** d20 \+ pillar Attack vs target pillar Defense.

* **Resistance:** Target rolls pillar Resilience vs DC 10 \+ effect rank (or uses degrees of failure vs that rank).

All attack effects:

* Count their rank toward **Effect** in the pillar’s **Attack \+ Effect ≤ OffCap** band.

* Interact with **Power Draws Blood** (Blood-Forward/Ward-Forward) by shifting OffCap/DefCap by ±2 in that pillar.

### **2.1 STRIKE (Violence Attack)**

**Tag:** Balanced  
 **Pillar:** Violence (Body)

**Strike (Violence)**  
 You deliver direct physical or material harm.

* Roll: Violence Attack vs target Body Defense.

* On a failed Resistance (Body Resilience) check, apply Violence conditions by degree:

  * 1st: **Injured** (−2 Body actions).

  * 2nd: **Maimed** (movement/combat options restricted).

  * 3rd: **Mortally Wounded** (Downed, dying, or disabled).

  * 4th: **Ruined Body** (campaign-scale injury or death absent major intervention).

* Base Cost: **1 SCP per rank**.

* Range: Close by default.

This is the baseline “Damage” analogue, tuned to your 4-step Violence track. Strong because of the 4th degree, but bounded by caps.

**Extras (Strike)**

1. **Accurate**

   * Effect: \+2 to this power’s Violence Attack only.

   * Cost: **\+1 flat SCP** (not per rank).

   * Band: Does **not** increase Effect rank, but obviously pushes you toward Attack+Effect cap when you lean on Attack.

2. **Area (Burst / Line / Cone)**

   * Effect: Strike affects everyone in a defined template around or from you. Each target resists separately.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank** (Area rank).

   * Band: Each rank of Area counts as \+1 “virtual rank” for OffCap checks (to avoid cheap, huge Areas).

   * Balance: **Strong** if combined with high rank; recommend only at mid/high SCL or with a Flaw (see Tiring).

3. **Brutal**

   * Effect: On a failed Resistance by **2+ degrees**, step the Violence condition **one extra stage** (e.g., from Maimed directly to Ruined Body in extreme cases).

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank** (max 1–2 ranks recommended).

   * Band: Counts as \+1 rank for OffCap.

   * Balance: **Strong**; should appear rarely at SCL 2\.

**Flaws (Strike)**

1. **Tiring (Blood)**

   * Effect: Each use marks **\+1 Blood** (Body-pillar cost track).

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank** (to a minimum cost of ½ SCP per rank; if you’d go below, treat as “2 ranks for 1 SCP”).

   * Narrative: You literally burn your body to hit like this.

2. **Limited: Vulnerable Targets Only**

   * Effect: Only works on a clearly defined subset (e.g., “Gu-infested targets”, “unarmored flesh”).

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * Balance: Keeps some high-rank “slayer” style Strikes on the table without breaking the general game.

---

### **2.2 INFLUENCE ATTACK (Social/Spiritual)**

**Tag:** Balanced  
 **Pillar:** Influence (Soul)

**Influence Attack**  
 You weaponize words, presence, or spiritual clout.

* Roll: Influence Attack vs target Soul Defense.

* Resistance: Soul Resilience.

* On failure, inflict Influence conditions by degree:

  * 1st: **Rattled** (−2 to Soul-based social actions).

  * 2nd: **Discredited** (ongoing penalties, reputation harm).

  * 3rd: **Isolated** (no leverage, ostracized in the current context).

  * 4th: **Shattered/Broken** (shared Mind/Soul 4th degree: socially/politically/spiritually “taken out” until major narrative repair).

* Base Cost: **1 SCP per rank**.

* Range: Usually Close or Ranged within line-of-sight.

Mechanically identical to Strike but on the Soul track. In fiction it is humiliation, spiritual binding, or public ruin.

**Extras (Influence Attack)**

1. **Mass Audience (Area: Crowd)**

   * Effect: Influence Attack targets a whole audience (e.g., a crowd, a livestream).

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Band: \+1 virtual rank toward OffCap as with Area.

   * Use: “Angel of Ratings”-style attacks that hit everyone watching.

2. **Lingering Rumor**

   * Effect: On 1st–2nd-degree failures, penalties persist across scenes until the target actively works to clear their name.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank** (max 2).

   * Balance: **Strong** if combined with Mass Audience.

3. **Subtle**

   * Effect: The target may not immediately recognize you as the source of their social/spiritual destruction.

   * Cost: **\+1 flat SCP**.

   * Interaction: Pairs well with Ward-Forward Influence builds.

**Flaws (Influence Attack)**

1. **Traceable**

   * Effect: It’s always obvious that you were the one who struck; you gain Exposure/Clout complications more easily.

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * Also: GM is encouraged to hit your Exposure/front clocks more often when you use this.

2. **Requires Setup**

   * Effect: Requires prior fictional positioning (e.g., prior scene planting rumors, obtaining blackmail).

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * This keeps powerful, campaign-scale social nukes fair.

---

### **2.3 REVELATION ATTACK (Sanity / Mystery)**

**Tag:** Balanced → Strong  
 **Pillar:** Revelation (Mind)

**Revelation Attack**  
 You confront a target with truth, horror, or cognitive overload.

* Roll: Revelation Attack vs Mind Defense.

* Resistance: Mind Resilience.

* On failure, apply Revelation conditions:

  * 1st: **Shaken** (−2 to Mind actions, brief cognitive shock).

  * 2nd: **Haunted** (recurring intrusive images/voices, ongoing penalties).

  * 3rd: **Deranged** (compulsions, severe disorientation, GM can impose short-term behaviors).

  * 4th: **Shattered/Broken** (catatonia, fugue, full compromise to an entity/pathway; requires exorcisms/interventions to reverse).

* Base Cost: **1 SCP per rank**.

Because the 4th degree is spiritually catastrophic, Revelation Attack is inherently a bit more dangerous than Strike/Influence, but the same caps and build constraints keep it in **Strong, not Broken**, territory.

**Extras (Revelation Attack)**

1. **Echoing**

   * Effect: The Revelation “echoes” in the target; on subsequent scenes with similar stimuli, they must reroll Mind Resilience vs a lower DC or have conditions flare back up.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Balance: Strong, but more narrative than raw combat.

2. **Contagious Insight**

   * Effect: Anyone who witnesses the target’s breakdown must also resist a lower-rank Revelation Attack (rank –2, min 1).

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Band: Counts as \+1 virtual rank toward OffCap.

3. **Piercing (Soul)**

   * Effect: May target **Soul Resilience** instead of Mind for certain eldritch truths that bypass rational defenses.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Use: Boss-tier “Revelation that hits your soul”.

**Flaws (Revelation Attack)**

1. **Backlash (Stain)**

   * Effect: Each use marks **\+1 Stain** on you (Revelation cost track: contamination, entity interest, or cosmological debt).

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * This is the key way to embed “Power Draws Blood” directly into Revelation powers.

2. **Limited: Prepared Space Only**

   * Effect: Only works in a properly prepared Domain (ritual circle, Gu-lamp hall, cursed theatre).

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * Fits bosses like the Gu Patriarch, whose Revelation is much stronger in his sanctum.

---

### **2.4 DEBILITATE (Affliction-Style Debuff)**

**Tag:** Strong (tightly scoped)  
 **Pillar:** Any (Violence / Influence / Revelation)

**Debilitate**  
 You impose non-damage hindrances on a target within a pillar, such as binding, fear, or exhaustion.

* Roll: Pillar Attack vs corresponding pillar Defense.

* Resistance: Matching Resilience (Body, Soul, or Mind).

* You pre-define a **3-step ladder** of conditions within that pillar for this power (e.g., Injured → Maimed → Downed for Violence; Rattled → Discredited → Isolated for Influence).

* On failure by 1–3 degrees, apply step 1–3.

* 4th degree (Shattered/Broken / Ruined Body) is **not** automatic from Debilitate; it must be triggered by fiction or specific Extras.

* Base Cost: **1 SCP per rank**.

This keeps Debilitate at “Strong but not auto-fight-ender” in most builds.

**Extras (Debilitate)**

1. **Escalating**

   * Effect: On a 3rd-degree failure, may escalate into the 4th-degree track state (Ruined Body or Shattered/Broken) if the fiction justifies it (e.g., execution scene, full possession).

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Balance: Use sparingly; this is where bosses push PCs into permanent consequences.

2. **Multi-Pillar**

   * Effect: Debilitate can apply either to Violence OR Influence OR Revelation (chosen at use), but still only one pillar at a time.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Band: \+1 virtual rank toward OffCap (flexibility tax).

3. **Cumulative**

   * Effect: Each successful Debilitate adds a “stack”; a new hit can move the target up one condition step even on a lesser degree failure.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Strong for controllers.

**Flaws (Debilitate)**

1. **Limited Degree**

   * Effect: Max condition is 2nd degree (no Isolated / Downed / Deranged).

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * Great for “soft control” or minor hexes.

2. **Tiring (Cost Track of Choice)**

   * Effect: Each use marks \+1 on a chosen track (**Blood**, **Fate**, or **Stain**) depending on descriptor.

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * Embeds “your curse costs you” into the build.

---

### **2.5 WARD (Defensive Buff / Armor)**

**Tag:** Balanced  
 **Pillar:** Any (Body / Soul / Mind)

**Ward**  
 You reinforce a pillar against harm, creating armor, blessings, or seals.

* Choose one pillar when you buy this effect:

  * **Body Ward**: \+rank to Body Resilience (physical armor / regeneration / Gu carapace).

  * **Soul Ward**: \+rank to Soul Resilience (social/spiritual armor, reputation bulwarks).

  * **Mind Ward**: \+rank to Mind Resilience (sanity wards, counter-memes, sigils).

* Duration: Sustained; drops if you stop maintaining it or are Shattered/Broken in that pillar.

* Base Cost: **1 SCP per rank**.

* Cap: Still respects the **Defense \+ Resilience ≤ DefCap** band, including any Ward you stack.

**Extras (Ward)**

1. **Aura**

   * Effect: Ward also protects allies within close range (e.g., “everyone within the Gu lamp halo” gains half the rank, rounded down).

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Band: Counts as \+1 virtual rank for DefCap checks when applied to yourself (it’s more potent overall).

2. **Reactive**

   * Effect: You may activate Ward as a reaction when you are attacked, applying its bonus before the Resistance roll.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Strong for tanks; should be monitored for overuse.

3. **Hardened**

   * Effect: Ward lets you ignore minor hits; against low-rank attacks, you treat a 1st-degree failure as success once per scene per rank.

   * Cost: **\+1 SCP per rank**.

   * Essentially a limited “impervious” analogue; treat as Strong.

**Flaws (Ward)**

1. **Anchored**

   * Effect: Ward only functions within a specific Domain or ritual context.

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

   * Great for boss lairs and sanctums.

2. **Fragile**

   * Effect: If you suffer a 2nd-degree or higher condition in that pillar, Ward collapses until you refresh it outside of combat.

   * Benefit: **−1 SCP per rank**.

---

## **3\. Sanity Check Against the Patriarch & SCL 2 PCs**

To confirm that these prices are in the right band, here is how they line up with what you already have.

### **3.1 Patriarch (SCL 5\) – Key Powers**

From the existing boss write-up:

* **Violence Strike (“Gu Claw Strike”)**

  * Violence Attack: \+6 (2 from Body 4, \+4 from traits).

  * Strike rank: 6\.

  * OffCap: 6 \+ 6 \= 12 (Balanced profile at SCL 5 → baseline 10, \+2 from PDB).

  * Cost: 6 SCP for Strike \+ \~4 SCP for Attack bonuses \= \~10 SCP.

* **Revelation Debilitate/Attack (“Hex of Crawling Insight”)**

  * Revelation Attack: \+7.

  * Effect: Revelation Attack rank 7 (Debilitate-style ladder up to Shattered/Broken).

  * OffCap: 7 \+ 7 \= 14 (Blood-Forward at SCL 5 → 2×5+2).

  * Cost: 7 SCP (effect) \+ \~4 SCP (attack) \= 11 SCP; \+Extras (Echoing / Backlash) at \+1/−1 SCP per rank as chosen.

* **Influence Attack (“Cult-Voice Command”)**

  * Attack \+4, Effect 6, OffCap 10 (Ward-Forward).

  * Cost: 6 SCP effect \+ \~3 SCP attack \= 9 SCP.

These numbers sit comfortably inside a 150-ish SCP boss budget, leaving plenty for Domains, Wards, and Gu toys.

### **3.2 SCL 2 PCs – Cinder-Fist as Example**

From the Body-lean PC:

* **Cinder Fist Strike**

  * Violence Attack: \+6.

  * Strike rank: 4\.

  * OffCap: 6 \+ 4 \= 10 (Blood-Forward at SCL 2 → 2×2+2).

  * Cost: 4 SCP (Strike ranks) \+ 3 SCP (attack bonuses) \= 7 SCP.

* With 60 SCP total, Cinder-Fist can comfortably spend:

  * \~18–20 SCP on Core/Aether,

  * 14–16 SCP on Violence Attack/Resilience/Strike,

  * 10–12 SCP on a small Ward and possibly a low-rank Debilitate,

  * 10–15 SCP on skills/utility.

This matches your design intent: PCs **must fight and grow into their ordained build path**; the boss is clearly out of their weight class in raw SCP and SCL, but the math is still on the same rails.

---

### **4\. Where This Leaves the SRD**

We now have, in SRD-ready form:

1. **SCL 2 starting band**

   * 60 SCP total.

   * Recommended Core/Aether and trait budgets.

   * Stat-profiled templates for Body/Soul/Mind-lean and Balanced.

2. **Final base costs** for:

   * **Strike (Violence)**

   * **Influence Attack**

   * **Revelation Attack**

   * **Debilitate**

   * **Ward**

3. A **consistent Extras/Flaws pattern** across those effects that:

   * Uses **\+1 SCP per rank** for powerful Extras.

   * Uses **−1 SCP per rank** for strong Flaws, especially those that mark **Blood/Fate/Stain**.

   * Respects OffCap/DefCap bands and the ±2 shift from **Power Draws Blood**.

If you want, the next step can be:

* Turning these into the actual **SRD chapter layout** (tables \+ boxed text), and/or

* Adding **two or three “signature packages”** (e.g., “Standard Cinder-Fist Strike package”, “Gu Patriarch Revelation package”) so that GMs can just lift prebuilt effect clusters instead of building from scratch.
