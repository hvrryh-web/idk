Below I’ll do three things in order:

1. Give you an analytical report on Core/Aether stats, how much they’re “worth”, what SCL \-1 looks like, and how SCP maps to M\&M PP and HERO CP.

2. Use that as context to write a **Boss Design Example** section for a specific boss (Gu Cult Patriarch), annotated with caps and budgets.

3. Build a **matching SCL 2 party** of three PCs (Body / Soul / Mind leans) and show how their builds and Power Draws Blood profiles give different answers to that boss.

---

## **I. Analytical Report – Core Stats, Attributes, SCL and SCP**

### **1\. Sources and comparison frame**

This review is based on:

* Baseline Mutants & Masterminds 3e: PL \+ PP structure and the “15 PP per Power Level” guideline.

* World of Aranth implementation \+ house rules (ability rebalancing, assumed house rules, sample PL 2–12 statblocks).

* HERO System / Champions 6e standard superheroic build levels (400 Total Points with \~75 points in Complications, plus point-distribution guidelines).

Your system goals:

* SCL is the **hidden PL**:

  * SCL 2 ≈ M\&M PL 4 (starting PCs).

  * SCL 4 ≈ M\&M PL 8 (“classic” hero baseline in this game’s lane).

* Core stats (Body, Mind, Soul) \+ Aether stats (Control, Fate, Spirit) **take over most of PL’s job** (offense/defense caps, “how big can a number be”).

* SCP (Soul-Core Points) is the **build currency**, analogous to M\&M Power Points and HERO Character Points.

### **2\. M\&M 3e / Aranth: what one PP buys**

Key facts:

* In standard M\&M 3e, a PL 10 hero typically has \~150 PP, i.e., \~15 PP per PL.

* Aranth uses that structure, but a lot of the actual builds in the Masterdoc hover around:

  * PL 2 civilians and street threats \~15–30 PP.

  * PL 6–8 operatives, elite soldiers, costumed vigilantes \~90–120 PP.

  * PL 10+ heroes and heavy assets \~150–180+ PP.

House-rule ability rebalancing is important:

* Each Ability rank gives multiple downstream benefits; e.g.:

  * Stamina: \+1 Toughness, \+1 Fortitude (≈ 2 PP of value for a 2 PP rank).

  * Agility/Dexterity/Fighting: mix of attack bonus, defense, initiative, and skills that is often **better than** buying traits piecemeal.

* Attack bonus is treated as 1 PP per rank in general; Melee or Ranged only is 1 PP per 2 ranks.

* Guiding principle: **“Pay once for a function”** and avoid double-paying via both Abilities and direct traits.

Intuition: in Aranth, a **single PP** is roughly the value of:

* \+1 to a specific combat defense,

* \+1 to a specific attack bonus,

* \+1 rank to a focused effect (Damage, Affliction, etc.),

* Or a “small” utility/trick.

That’s the baseline your SCP should shadow.

### **3\. HERO / Champions 6e: what one CP buys**

In Champions / HERO 6e:

* Standard superhero: **400 Total Points**, typically with **75 points of Matching Complications**.

* “Superheroic” games generally expect that 400-point characters hit certain benchmarks for offensive dice, defenses, and skills.

* A 175-point Heroic character (no superpowers, just highly competent) sits far below that threshold.

Rough equivalence (by feel rather than strict math):

* A PL 10 / 150 PP M\&M hero is broadly comparable in table impact to a 350–400 point Champions superhero.

* That implies a rough mapping of **1 PP ≈ 2.5–3 HERO CP** (150 PP × \~2.7 ≈ 400 CP).

For our purposes, SCP can be treated as:

1 SCP ≈ 1 M\&M PP ≈ 2.5–3 Champions CP in “weight”.

The key design outcome: an SCL 4 / \~120 SCP hero should feel like a **standard Champions 400-point superhero** at the table.

### **4\. Proposed SCL → hidden PL and SCP budgets**

Given your constraints:

* SCL 2 ⇒ PL 4 (starting PCs).

* SCL 4 ⇒ PL 8 (classic hero baseline for this game’s “street-to-global horror” lane).

We can formalize:

* **Hidden PL \= 2 × SCL** (for PCs and near-PC threats in the mortal band).

  * SCL 2 ⇒ PL 4\.

  * SCL 3 ⇒ PL 6\.

  * SCL 4 ⇒ PL 8\.

* We keep the M\&M guideline of **15 PP per PL** and just convert PL → SCL:

SCP budget per SCL ≈ 30 × SCL, floored at 0 for low SCL.

So:

* SCL \-1: **0 SCP** (mundane baseline, no build currency).

* SCL 0: 0 SCP (still basically mundane).

* SCL 1: **30 SCP** (roughly PL 2 “dangerous human / early awakened”).

* SCL 2: **60 SCP** (PL 4 starting PCs).

* SCL 3: **90 SCP** (PL 6 dangerous mid-boss / elite).

* SCL 4: **120 SCP** (PL 8 classic supers).

This keeps the intuitive “30 points per SCL step” while hard-capping mortals at SCL 4 for the core book.

### **5\. Derived levels: CL, SL and SCL**

You specified:

* **CL (Core Level)** from \[Body, Mind, Soul\]

* **SL (Soul Level)** from \[Control, Fate, Spirit\]

* **SCL \= CL \+ SL**

We keep your simulationist cultivation:

CL \= ⌊(Body \+ Mind \+ Soul) / 3⌋  
 SL \= ⌊(Control \+ Fate \+ Spirit) / 3⌋  
 SCL \= CL \+ SL

Design use:

* **Build gate:** You cannot claim SCL N unless CL \+ SL \= N.

* **Advancement:** Each time CL \+ SL rises, your SCL rises and you unlock a new 30 SCP “band” of budget that you can spend on primaries, techniques, and powers.

* **Cultivation feel:** You raise stats; that raises CL/SL; that raises SCL; SCL increase then allows higher caps and new budget.

### **6\. Starting attributes for SCL \-1**

SCL \-1 is your **pre-awakening mortal baseline**.

Given your stat range of \-1 to \+11, and the desire for “Aether negative before awakening”, a clean baseline is:

* **Core stats** (material self):

  * Body 0, Mind 0, Soul 0\.

* **Aether stats** (immaterial self):

  * Control \-1, Fate \-1, Spirit \-1.

This gives:

* CL \= ⌊(0+0+0)/3⌋ \= 0\.

* SL \= ⌊(-1-1-1)/3⌋ \= \-1.

* SCL \= \-1.

Interpretation:

* Body/Mind/Soul 0 means “ordinary modern adult”.

* Control/Fate/Spirit \-1 \= “no conscious access to cultivation, cursed technique, or Dao; you are *beneath* the lowest Sequence in spiritual terms.”

No SCP is assigned at SCL \-1; any deviations from this are narrative (e.g., a fit soldier with Body 1 and some training) and can be treated as NPC templates.

### **7\. Value of a Core / Aether rank and attributes**

We now have to answer “how much is one rank worth” in SCP terms.

#### **7.1. Pillars and defenses**

We tie the three pillars to Core stats:

* **Violence (Material / Physical):**

  * Body Defense (dodge/parry equivalent).

  * Body Resilience (toughness/fortitude equivalent).

* **Revelation (Sanity / Abstract / Mystery):**

  * Mind Defense (mental / perception defense).

  * Mind Resilience (sanity/soul-shock resistance).

* **Influence (Social / Spiritual):**

  * Soul Defense (social/spiritual dodge).

  * Soul Resilience (reputation/faith/spirit armor).

We keep the classic PL cap logic, translated:

* **Violence caps:**

  * Violence Attack \+ Violence Effect ≤ 4 × SCL (baseline).

  * Body Defense \+ Body Resilience ≤ 4 × SCL (baseline).

* **Revelation caps:**

  * Revelation Attack \+ Revelation Effect ≤ 4 × SCL.

  * Mind Defense \+ Mind Resilience ≤ 4 × SCL.

* **Influence caps:**

  * Influence Attack \+ Influence Effect ≤ 4 × SCL.

  * Soul Defense \+ Soul Resilience ≤ 4 × SCL.

Power Draws Blood lets you flex ±2 on these bands by sacrificing the inverse (see below).

#### **7.2. Core/Aether rank functions**

For the mortal band, assign:

* **Each rank of Body:**

  * \+1 Violence Attack (melee / close).

  * \+1 Body Resilience (toughness/fortitude band).

* **Each rank of Mind:**

  * \+1 Revelation Attack (mystic/mental).

  * \+1 Mind Resilience (sanity/resistance).

* **Each rank of Soul:**

  * \+1 Influence Attack (social/cursed speech).

  * \+1 Soul Resilience (social/spiritual).

And:

* **Each rank of Control:**

  * \+1 maximum Fury pool,

  * \+1 cap to Violence Overclock effects and “safe” escalation before Blood ticks.

* **Each rank of Fate:**

  * \+1 maximum Clout pool,

  * \+1 reroll/bargain “capacity” before Fate track advances.

* **Each rank of Spirit:**

  * \+1 maximum Insight pool,

  * \+1 warding / Domain stability tier before Stain escalates.

Valuation:

* Each Core/Aether rank directly provides \~2 “PP-equivalent” benefits (one offensive, one defensive, or one pool \+ 1 meta-threshold).

* We therefore price:

**Core / Aether Rank Cost: 2 SCP per rank.**

This keeps them in line with M\&M Ability costs (2 PP/rank) while avoiding the more egregious value spikes of some original Abilities.

#### **7.3. Secondary attributes and traits**

Secondary stats (Strength, Endurance, Agility, Technique, Willpower, Focus, Essence, Resolve, Presence) and trait-like elements (skills, advantages, techniques) should each roughly be worth:

* **1 SCP per rank** when they give a single focused benefit (e.g., \+1 to a single attack, \+1 to a particular Resistance, \+2 skill ranks).

* More if they are multi-function (similar to how some Advantages or Powers in M\&M are under/over-costed in the Character Guide’s assessment).

Baseline guidance:

* \+1 to a specific attack bonus, defense, or resilience: 1 SCP.

* \+2 ranks in a skill/specialty: 1 SCP.

* \+1 rank of a standard “Strike”-style damage effect (per pillar) without extras: 1 SCP.

* Powers with strong Extras/Flaws are built as per your trimmed effect list and balanced against this 1 SCP “rank unit”.

### **8\. SCP budgets per SCL and where “Core stats are given by SCL upgrades” fits**

Given 30 SCP per SCL:

* **At SCL 2 (starting PCs):**

  * Total SCP budget: 60\.

  * Recommended baseline allocation:

    * 24 SCP → 12 ranks across Core \+ Aether (6 core \+ 6 aether; 2 SCP each).

    * 12 SCP → secondaries (skills, techniques, advantages).

    * 24 SCP → powers and Domains (actual supernatural effects).

This aligns reasonably with Champions “400-point guideline” where \~40% of points go to characteristics, \~25% to skills, and \~35% to powers. We just compress it to a narrower power band.

“Core stats are given by SCL upgrades” then becomes:

* **On each SCL increase**, you unlock an additional **30 SCP** AND a recommended **“Core Package”** of \+2 Core ranks and \+2 Aether ranks (costing 8 SCP) to keep CL and SL roughly tracking the new SCL.

* Players can deviate from this, but if CL \+ SL doesn’t reach the new SCL, they’re “under-cultivated” for their apparent tier; if CL \+ SL would push beyond the allotted SCL, they must wait narratively to “crystallize” the new SCL.

### **9\. Power Draws Blood – numeric layer**

Mechanically realizing “Power Draws Blood”:

For each pillar (Violence, Influence, Revelation) you choose at build time:

* **Balanced:**

  * Offense band: Attack \+ Effect ≤ 4 × SCL.

  * Defense band: Defense \+ Resilience ≤ 4 × SCL.

* **Blood-Forward:**

  * Offense band: Attack \+ Effect ≤ 4 × SCL \+ 2\.

  * Defense band: Defense \+ Resilience ≤ 4 × SCL − 2\.

  * Narrative: you hit harder / warp reality more, but your protections are thinned and Blood/Fate/Stain costs tick faster.

* **Ward-Forward:**

  * Offense band: Attack \+ Effect ≤ 4 × SCL − 2\.

  * Defense band: Defense \+ Resilience ≤ 4 × SCL \+ 2\.

  * Narrative: you turtle behind shells, domains, and social armor.

This ±2 trade is how specialization and cost tracks intersect with caps.

### **10\. Observations, intuitions, and design philosophy**

**Observations:**

* Aranth’s house rules already treat Attributes as “buckets” that buy multiple things at once, but it relies on careful GMing to avoid double-pay and broken combos.

* HERO’s 400-point standard superhero gives a very clear feel: you want **some** characteristic investment, **some** skills, **some** powers, and it uses a single currency to do that.

* Your cultivation framing wants **stats to be the truth** of a character’s level: CL and SL should not be arbitrary numbers; they should emerge from Body/Mind/Soul and Control/Fate/Spirit.

**Intuition:**

* SCL as CL+SL with 30 SCP per SCL gives you both: you track cultivation as stats, and you track “build currency” as SCP.

* Core/Aether at 2 SCP per rank gives them enough weight that they represent genuine investment, but not so much that they overshadow powers.

* Secondary stats and effects at 1 SCP per rank mirror M\&M’s 1 PP per \+1 pattern for focused traits.

**Design Philosophy Statement (for this part of the game):**

**Design Philosophy: Cultivated Cores, Measured Power.**

In this engine, a character’s true level is the sum of their cultivated Core and Aether – Body, Mind, Soul and Control, Fate, Spirit. These six stats define CL, SL, and SCL, which in turn set the numeric limits for all offensive and defensive traits. SCP (Soul-Core Points) is a single, transparent currency that buys traits, but it does so in a way that always respects SCL-driven caps. Inspired by Mutants & Masterminds’ PL+PP model and Champions’ point-based, characteristic-forward builds, the system aims for a “crunchy build, focused play” experience: strong character optimization games within clear bands of fairness. Power Draws Blood enforces the core motif: every push toward specialized offense or unbreakable defense comes at a visible cost to the inverse, tracked in both numbers and narrative scars.

## **II. Boss Design Example – Gu Cult Patriarch (SCL 3\)**

Now we apply this logic to a concrete boss and annotate where caps and budgets hit.

### **1\. Boss concept and tier**

**Gu Cult Patriarch** – SCL 3 Boss (Violence/Revelation hybrid)

* Role: Mid-season boss; apex of a city-scale Gu Cult arc.

* Hidden PL: 2 × SCL \= **PL 6**.

* SCP Budget: 30 × SCL \= **90 SCP** (≈ 150% of a single SCL 2 PC).

* Encounter assumption: 3 × SCL 2 PCs vs 1 Patriarch, plus a few minions.

### **2\. Power Draws Blood profiles**

* **Violence (Body pillar):** Balanced

  * Wants to survive long enough to use Revelation.

* **Revelation (Mind pillar):** Blood-Forward

  * He weaponizes cosmic insight at the expense of his own sanity.

* **Influence (Soul pillar):** Ward-Forward

  * He’s socially and spiritually hard to dislodge, even if his offense there is weaker.

Numerically, at SCL 3:

* Baseline cap: 4 × 3 \= 12\.

* **Violence (Balanced):**

  * Violence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 12

  * Body Defense \+ Body Resilience ≤ 12

* **Revelation (Blood-Forward):**

  * Revelation Attack \+ Effect ≤ 14

  * Mind Defense \+ Mind Resilience ≤ 10

* **Influence (Ward-Forward):**

  * Influence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 10

  * Soul Defense \+ Soul Resilience ≤ 14

### **3\. Core / Aether stats (SCP annotation)**

Allocate 24 SCP → Core/Aether (12 ranks @ 2 SCP):

* **Core:**

  * Body 2, Mind 3, Soul 1 (2+3+1 \= 6 → CL \= ⌊6/3⌋ \= 2\)

* **Aether:**

  * Control 2, Fate 1, Spirit 2 (2+1+2 \= 5 → SL \= ⌊5/3⌋ \= 1\)

* **SCL \= CL \+ SL \= 3** – matches target.

Narrative:

* Physically capable but truly terrifying in Revelation (Mind 3).

* Control/Spirit give him strong Fury/Insight management and Domain stability; Fate is weaker (his bargains are risky).

SCP spent so far: **24 / 90 SCP**.

### **4\. Derived bands and examples**

From stats \+ 1 SCP/rank trait buys, we build:

#### **Violence (Body pillar – Balanced)**

Target bands:

* Violence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 12\.

* Body Defense \+ Body Resilience ≤ 12\.

Sample allocation:

* Violence Attack: \+6

  * 2 from Body, \+4 from secondaries/powers (4 SCP).

* Violence Effect (Gu Claw Strike): rank 6 (6 SCP).

→ Offense band: 6 \+ 6 \= 12 (at cap).

* Body Defense (Dodge/Parry equivalent): \+5

* Body Resilience (Physical Toughness/Fortitude): \+7

→ Defense band: 5 \+ 7 \= 12 (at cap).

Violence SCP subtotal: \~10 SCP (4 attack-focused, 6 damage ranks).

#### **Revelation (Mind pillar – Blood-Forward)**

Target bands:

* Revelation Attack \+ Effect ≤ 14\.

* Mind Defense \+ Mind Resilience ≤ 10\.

Sample allocation:

* Revelation Attack (“Hex of Crawling Insight”): \+7

  * 3 from Mind, \+4 from traits (4 SCP).

* Revelation Effect (Affliction vs Sanity): rank 7 (7 SCP)

→ Offense band: 7 \+ 7 \= 14 (using the \+2 Blood-Forward flex).

* Mind Defense (resisting other mental powers): \+4

* Mind Resilience (sanity armor): \+6

→ Defense band: 4 \+ 6 \= 10 (down from 12 due to Blood-Forward profile).

Revelation SCP subtotal: \~11 SCP (4 attack, 7 effect).

This column is where he threatens to push PCs toward Haunted/Deranged/Shattered conditions.

#### **Influence (Soul pillar – Ward-Forward)**

Target bands:

* Influence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 10\.

* Soul Defense \+ Soul Resilience ≤ 14\.

Sample allocation:

* Influence Attack (“Cult-Voice Command”): \+4

  * 1 from Soul, \+3 from traits (3 SCP).

* Influence Effect (weaker Affliction vs social standing / compulsion): rank 6 (6 SCP).

→ Offense band: 4 \+ 6 \= 10 (two below baseline 12).

* Soul Defense (vs social/magical pressure): \+7

* Soul Resilience (spiritual/social armor): \+7

→ Defense band: 7 \+ 7 \= 14 (two above baseline 12).

Influence SCP subtotal: \~9 SCP (3 attack, 6 effect).

### **5\. Remaining budget: skills, techniques, and Gu powers**

We’ve used:

* 24 SCP (Core/Aether).

* \~30 SCP (Violence/Revelation/Influence bands).

Subtotal: \~54 SCP → **36 SCP left**.

We can invest that in:

* Gu Domain and special techniques (rough SCP sketch):

  * **Gu Hive Domain** (Area, ongoing minion pressure): 12 SCP.

  * **Self-Inflicted Gu Overclock** (once-per-scene self-buff that adds \+2 Effect to Revelation at immediate Blood/Fate cost): \~8 SCP as a limited extra.

  * **Gu Swarm Minions** (PL 2 / SCL \-1–0 equivalents as a small swarm array): \~10 SCP.

  * **Skills, rituals, cult network** (Investigation, Expertise \[Gu Lore\], Deception, etc.): \~6 SCP.

We stay within 90 SCP total, and **every pillar’s bands are clearly inside the allowed caps**.

---

## **III. Matching SCL 2 Party Sample (Body / Soul / Mind)**

Now, build three SCL 2 PCs (60 SCP each) whose Power Draws Blood profiles and Domains interact differently with the Gu Cult Patriarch.

All three:

* SCL 2 ⇒ hidden PL 4\.

* Caps baseline: 4 × 2 \= **8** (modified by PDB profiles).

* Core build budget: assume \~22–26 SCP into Core/Aether, remainder into traits/powers.

I will focus on the high-signal elements rather than exhaustively spending every point.

---

### **A. Body-Lean PC – “Cinder-Fist Remnant”**

**Concept:**  
 Former experimental subject who bonded with a fire-Gu swarm. Frontline striker who uses Violence to keep the Patriarch locked down.

#### **1\. SCL and stats**

* SCL: 2 (PL 4 equivalent).

* Core stats (14 SCP → 7 ranks):

  * Body 3, Mind 1, Soul 1 (3+1+1 \= 5 → CL \= ⌊5/3⌋ \= 1).

* Aether stats (12 SCP → 6 ranks):

  * Control 2, Fate 2, Spirit 0 (2+2+0 \= 4 → SL \= ⌊4/3⌋ \= 1).

* SCL \= CL \+ SL \= 2\.

Total SCP used on Core/Aether \= 26; remaining ≈ 34 SCP.

#### **2\. Power Draws Blood profile**

* **Violence:** Blood-Forward

* **Revelation:** Balanced

* **Influence:** Balanced

At SCL 2:

* Baseline: 4 × 2 \= 8\.

* Violence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 10, Body Defense \+ Body Resilience ≤ 6\.

* Other pillars remain at standard 8/8.

#### **3\. Violence bands vs Patriarch**

Spend \~16 SCP on Violence traits:

* Violence Attack (“Cinder Fist”): \+6

  * 3 from Body, \+3 from traits (3 SCP).

* Violence Effect (“Cinder Fist” Damage): rank 4 (4 SCP).

→ Offense band: 6 \+ 4 \= 10 (maxed for Blood-Forward at SCL 2).

* Body Defense: \+3 (Body 3; no extra SCP).

* Body Resilience: \+3 (Body 3; optionally \+0–1 more SCP).

→ Defense band: 3 \+ 3 \= 6 (matches lowered cap).

**At the table vs Patriarch:**

* Cinder-Fist can seriously threaten the Patriarch’s **Body Resilience 7** with a focused hit, especially if Fury is spent for rerolls/boosts.

* However, with only a 6-point defense band in Violence, he is very vulnerable to the Patriarch’s Violence 6/6 bands and Gu swarm dogpiling.

#### **4\. Domains and cost tracks**

* **Domain:** “Cinder-Gu Colony” – burning parasite insects in his blood.

* **Fury / Blood:**

  * High Control 2 means decent Fury pool and Overclock safety for Violence.

  * He accrues Blood quickly when nova-ing, risking long-term bodily and Gu-mutational consequences (Ruined Body if pushed too hard).

**Answer to boss:**  
 He is the **primary HP and defense shredder** for the party. His job is to drive the Patriarch into Violence conditions (Injured → Maimed → Mortally Wounded → Ruined Body) while trusting others to manage Revelation and Influence.

---

### **B. Soul-Lean PC – “Silk-Tongue Medium”**

**Concept:**  
 A Gu Contract Medium who brokered a deal with a “Court of Hungry Ancestors”. She fights via Influence – binding cultists, disrupting worship, and reshaping the Patriarch’s social/dominion footing.

#### **1\. SCL and stats**

* SCL: 2\.

* Core stats (14 SCP):

  * Body 0, Mind 1, Soul 3 (0+1+3 \= 4 → CL \= ⌊4/3⌋ \= 1).

* Aether stats (12 SCP):

  * Control 0, Fate 2, Spirit 2 (0+2+2 \= 4 → SL \= ⌊4/3⌋ \= 1).

* SCL \= 2\.

26 SCP on Core/Aether; \~34 SCP left.

#### **2\. Power Draws Blood profile**

* **Violence:** Ward-Forward (she avoids physical harm).

* **Revelation:** Balanced (she can confront weirdness but is not a Mind-alpha).

* **Influence:** Blood-Forward (she spends herself socially/spiritually).

At SCL 2:

* Influence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 10; Soul Defense \+ Soul Resilience ≤ 6\.

* Violence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 6; Body Defense \+ Body Resilience ≤ 10\.

#### **3\. Influence vs Patriarch**

Invest \~18 SCP in Influence:

* Influence Attack (“Ancestor-Court Edict” – social/spirit compulsion): \+5

  * 3 from Soul, \+2 from traits (2 SCP).

* Influence Effect (Affliction vs Shaken → Haunted → Deranged/Shattered in social/political space): rank 5 (5 SCP).

→ Offense band: 5 \+ 5 \= 10 (maxed with Blood-Forward).

* Soul Defense: \+2 (Soul 3, but some diverted into offense; effectively she accepts being “open” socially).

* Soul Resilience: \+4 (Soul 3 \+ 1 SCP invest).

→ Defense band: 2 \+ 4 \= 6 (Blood-Forward lowered cap).

**At the table vs Patriarch:**

* She directly contests the Patriarch’s Influence band (4/6 offense vs 7/7 defense/resilience). She won’t easily “win” head-on, but she can:

  * Target his **cultists**, stripping them away and weakening his Domain.

  * Force political/social conditions: Discredited → Isolated → Shattered/Broken (shared condition ladder for Mind/Soul at 4th degree).

With Fate 2 and Spirit 2, she has strong Clout and Insight pools:

* **Clout / Fate:** rerolls/bargains with the Gu Court and locals.

* **Blood / Stain:** taking Blood-Forward in Influence means she eats Stain quickly – social fractures, ancestral backlash, etc.

**Answer to boss:**  
 She is the **boss breaker via environment**: undermine the Patriarch’s narrative, cult, and support structure so the fight does not become a straight Revelation slugfest.

---

### **C. Mind-Lean PC – “Script-Eyed Analyst”**

**Concept:**  
 An occult analyst who treats Gu and Domains as data structures. He leans into Revelation to map, predict, and counter the Patriarch’s Gu Hive and cosmic patterns.

#### **1\. SCL and stats**

* SCL: 2\.

* Core stats (14 SCP):

  * Body 0, Mind 3, Soul 1 (0+3+1 \= 4 → CL \= ⌊4/3⌋ \= 1).

* Aether stats (12 SCP):

  * Control 1, Fate 1, Spirit 2 (1+1+2 \= 4 → SL \= 1).

* SCL \= 2; 26 SCP used, 34 left.

#### **2\. Power Draws Blood profile**

* **Violence:** Balanced (he is not focused here).

* **Revelation:** Blood-Forward (he pushes his mind hard).

* **Influence:** Ward-Forward (he is wary socially but well-defended spiritually).

At SCL 2:

* Revelation Attack \+ Effect ≤ 10; Mind Defense \+ Mind Resilience ≤ 6\.

* Influence Attack \+ Effect ≤ 6; Soul Defense \+ Soul Resilience ≤ 10\.

#### **3\. Revelation vs Patriarch**

Invest \~20 SCP in Revelation:

* Revelation Attack (“Script-Eye Gu Debugging” – targeted Revelation strike): \+6

  * 3 from Mind, \+3 from traits (3 SCP).

* Revelation Effect (Debilitate-type Affliction vs Gu / Domains – imposing Shaken → Haunted → Deranged / Shattered on Gu constructs themselves): rank 4 (4 SCP).

→ Offense band: 6 \+ 4 \= 10 (Blood-Forward cap).

* Mind Defense: \+3 (Mind 3).

* Mind Resilience: \+3 (invest 1 SCP).

→ Defense band: 3 \+ 3 \= 6 (Blood-Forward lowered).

He also invests in:

* **Gu System Diagnostics** (Senses: Detect Gu, Analyze Domains, etc.) – 6–8 SCP.

* **Counter-Rituals / Wards** (to protect party from Revelation splash) – 6–8 SCP.

* Skills: Expertise \[Gu Systems\], Investigation, Insight – 6–8 SCP.

**At the table vs Patriarch:**

* He is the **direct Revelation counterpoint**:

  * Patriarch Revelation band: 7/7 (14 offense) vs 4/6 (10 defense) – he outguns the Analyst.

  * But the Analyst can surgically target **Gu Hive Domain**, cutting bonuses, removing Gu from the Patriarch, and turning his self-inflicted Overclocks into real vulnerability.

* His Spirit 2 and Influence Ward-Forward make him relatively safe from the Patriarch’s social/spiritual assaults.

**Answer to boss:**  
 He is the **mage breaker / puzzle solver**, reading the Gu ritual, predicting when the Patriarch will Overclock, and giving the party the window to strike.

---

## **IV. How the trio’s builds answer the Gu Cult Patriarch**

Putting it together:

1. **Caps and SCL logic in play**

* PCs: SCL 2 → hidden PL 4 → baseline bands 8, flexed to 10 or 6 by PDB.

* Boss: SCL 3 → hidden PL 6 → baseline bands 12, flexed to 14 or 10 by PDB.

From a raw numeric standpoint, the Patriarch outclasses any individual PC in any pillar. But:

* He is **balanced, not spiking**, in Violence.

* He is **blood-forward and risky** in Revelation.

* He is **ward-forward and conservative** in Influence.

2. **Role answers**

* **Cinder-Fist Remnant (Body / Violence Blood-Forward)**

  * Takes the **Violence pillar head-on**, using Fury and Overclock to deliver PL 6-quality hits with a PL 4 body, at the cost of severe Blood ticks and low defense.

* **Silk-Tongue Medium (Soul / Influence Blood-Forward)**

  * Engages at the **Influence layer**, stripping away Gu followers, weakening Domains, pushing the Patriarch toward Shattered/Broken socially and politically.

* **Script-Eyed Analyst (Mind / Revelation Blood-Forward)**

  * Acts at the **Revelation layer**, debugging Gu systems, shortening the time the boss can safely sit at his Blood-Forward Revelation offense before mentally collapsing.

3. **Boss design example goals satisfied**

* **Caps applied:**

  * Every pillar’s Attack \+ Effect and Defense \+ Resilience is explicitly kept within 4×SCL ±2 per PDB profile for both boss and PCs.

* **SCL / stats / SCP budgets:**

  * SCL→hidden PL and SCP budgets are consistent with M\&M and Champions expectations for power bands.

  * Core/Aether ranks are costed at 2 SCP per rank and drive CL, SL, and thus SCL.

  * PCs at 60 SCP and boss at 90 SCP approximately implement the “150% boss strength vs one PC” heuristic and \~1.5× individual impact, with the action economy of three PCs balancing the encounter.

If you like this structure, the next layer would be:

* Full mechanical write-ups of each PC and the Patriarch in your effect-list notation (Strike / Debilitate / Drain, etc.),

* Explicit Blood/Fate/Stain track values per SCL and per Domain,

* And at least one additional boss stage where the Patriarch either shifts PDB profiles mid-fight or changes which pillar he emphasizes (e.g., Revelation → Violence when cornered).
