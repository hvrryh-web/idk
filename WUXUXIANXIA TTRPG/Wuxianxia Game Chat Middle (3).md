Below is a continuous, SRD-style “core spine” for the next layer of the game, focused on:

1. Finalising CL/SL/SCL ladders \+ SCP budgets for SCL 2–4.  
2. Locking Character Creation (Chapter 4\) in numbered format.  
3. Making it easy to plug back into your existing examples (Gu Cult Patriarch \+ SCL 2 PCs) by referencing the 3.3.x effects.

I’ll treat this as text you can paste straight into your draft and rearrange chapter numbers later if needed.

# **2.5 Soul-Core Levels, Caps & Budgets**

## **2.5.1 Core Level, Soul Level, Soul Core Level**

**2.5.1.1 Core Stats and Aether Stats**

1. The game uses **three Core Stats** and **three Aether Stats**:  
   * Core: **Body, Mind, Soul.**  
   * Aether: **Control, Fate, Spirit.**  
2. Each stat normally ranges from **−1 to \+11** for mortal play.  
3. Each \+1 rank in any Core or Aether stat:  
   * Costs **2 SCP**.  
   * Provides a **\+1 modifier** to all associated checks and derived traits.

**2.5.1.2 Derived Levels**

1. **Core Level (CL)** measures cultivated Body/Mind/Soul:  
   * `CL = ⌊(Body + Mind + Soul) / 3⌋`.  
2. **Soul Level (SL)** measures cultivated Control/Fate/Spirit:  
   * `SL = ⌊(Control + Fate + Spirit) / 3⌋`.  
3. **Soul Core Level (SCL)** is the sum:  
   * `SCL = CL + SL`.  
4. **SCL** is the game’s **hidden Power Level**:  
   * It drives caps, SCP budgets, and encounter balance.  
   * It is **not** normally shown to players as a number; use fiction-facing labels instead if desired.

**2.5.1.3 Relation to Classic M\&M PL**

1. For balance purposes, treat:  
   * `Hidden PL ≈ 2 × SCL`.  
2. Approximate mapping:  
   * **SCL 2 ≈ PL 4** (street-tier).  
   * **SCL 3 ≈ PL 6** (elite agents).  
   * **SCL 4 ≈ PL 8** (classic hero baseline).  
3. Attack & Effect caps follow the same *structure* as M\&M’s “Attack \+ Effect ≤ 2 × PL”, but rescaled to SCL (see 2.5.3).

---

## **2.5.2 SCL Bands & SCP Budgets (Mortal Tier)**

**2.5.2.1 SCP Budget per SCL**

1. Inspired by M\&M’s guideline of **15 PP per PL**, a Wuxianxia character receives **30 SCP per SCL** (since PL ≈ 2 × SCL).  
2. Total starting SCP:  
   * `Total SCP = 30 × SCL` (for PCs built at that SCL).

**2.5.2.2 Mortal SCL Ladder (Play Space for Core Book)**

Use this as the **default mortal range** for the core rulebook:

| SCL | Approx. PL Feel | Fictional Tier (Mortal) | Typical Total SCP | Use Case |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| −1 | \< PL 1 | Fragile civilians, children | 0–10 SCP | Background, non-combatants |
| 0 | PL 1–2 | Untrained adults, basic soldiers | 10–30 SCP | Mooks, crowd NPCs |
| 1 | PL 3 | Minor Dreamers, rookies | 30 SCP | Weak PCs, sidekicks |
| **2** | **PL 4** | **Street-tier PCs (default start)** | **60 SCP** | Standard starting heroes |
| 3 | PL 6 | Elite agents, city-scale threats | 90 SCP | Advanced PCs, strong rivals |
| **4** | **PL 8** | **Full heroes, national threats** | **120 SCP** | Late-campaign PCs, bosses |
| 5 | PL 10 | Regional disasters, early demigods | 150+ SCP | Endgame bosses, Patriarchs |

You can extend SCL 6+ for Immortal / Transcendent play later; for now, the core book focuses on **SCL 2–4**.

---

## **2.5.3 Offense & Defense Caps (OffCap / DefCap)**

**2.5.3.1 Pillars and Bands**

1. There are **three conflict pillars**:  
   * **Violence** (Body).  
   * **Influence** (Soul/social/spiritual).  
   * **Revelation** (Mind/sanity/mystery).  
2. Each pillar has:  
   * An **Offense band**: `Attack bonus + Effect rank`.  
   * A **Defense band**: `Defense + Resilience`.

**2.5.3.2 Baseline Caps (Balanced Profile)**

1. For a character with a **Balanced** Power Draws Blood profile in a pillar:  
   * **Offense Cap** (OffCap):  
     `Attack + Effect ≤ 4 × SCL`.  
   * **Defense Cap** (DefCap):  
     `Defense + Resilience ≤ 4 × SCL`.  
2. This mirrors M\&M’s “Attack \+ Effect ≤ 2 × PL” once you apply `PL ≈ 2 × SCL`.

**2.5.3.3 Power Draws Blood Profiles (PDB)**

1. For each pillar (Violence, Influence, Revelation), a PC chooses one of:  
   * **Balanced**.  
   * **Blood-Forward** (Offense-heavy).  
   * **Ward-Forward** (Defense-heavy).  
2. This profile permanently shifts caps in that pillar:  
   * **Balanced:**  
     `OffCap = 4 × SCL`, `DefCap = 4 × SCL`.  
   * **Blood-Forward:**  
     `OffCap = 4 × SCL + 2`, `DefCap = 4 × SCL − 2`.  
   * **Ward-Forward:**  
     `OffCap = 4 × SCL − 2`, `DefCap = 4 × SCL + 2`.  
3. PDB is also the **primary hook** for Blood/Fate/Stain tracks and for any SCP discounts tied to risk-heavy builds (see design notes you have on Champions-style Limitations).

**2.5.3.4 Suggested Individual Trait Bounds (Optional)**

For tables that want an upper bound on any single number:

1. Suggested **soft individual cap**:  
   * `Attack ≤ 3 × SCL`, `Effect ≤ 3 × SCL`.  
   * `Defense ≤ 3 × SCL`, `Resilience ≤ 3 × SCL`.  
2. These are guidelines only; the **hard caps** are the bands in 2.5.3.2–3.

---

## **2.5.4 SCL 2 Packages (Default Start)**

These are **recommended build skeletons** for SCL 2 PCs. They ensure CL/SL maths work and support your “grow into your ordained path” fantasy.

### **2.5.4.1 Shared Assumptions**

1. **Total SCP**: 60\.  
2. **Core/Aether Stat Costs**:  
   * Each \+1 rank: 2 SCP.  
3. **Recommended Allocation at SCL 2**:  
   * **16–20 SCP** into Core \+ Aether (8–10 total ranks).  
   * **16–20 SCP** into Attacks, Defenses, Resiliences.  
   * **20–28 SCP** into Effects (Strike, Influence, Revelation, Debilitate, Ward) and incidental traits.

This keeps characters within “street supers” range similar to PL 4 in M\&M while still feeling competent.

---

### **2.5.4.2 Balanced SCL 2 Package**

**2.5.4.2.1 Core & Aether Stats (Example)**

* **Core** (sum ≈ 4, CL \= 1):  
  * Body 2, Mind 1, Soul 1\.  
* **Aether** (sum ≈ 4, SL \= 1):  
  * Control 2, Fate 1, Spirit 1\.  
* **Result**: CL 1 \+ SL 1 \= **SCL 2**.

Total: 8 ranks × 2 SCP \= 16 SCP.

**2.5.4.2.2 Caps (Balanced in All Pillars)**

* All pillars:  
  * OffCap \= 4 × 2 \= **8**.  
  * DefCap \= 4 × 2 \= **8**.  
* Typical Violence band examples:  
  * Attack \+4, Strike 4\.  
  * Or Attack \+6, Strike 2 (trade-off).

---

### **2.5.4.3 Body-Lean SCL 2 Package**

**2.5.4.3.1 Core & Aether Stats (Example)**

* Core (Body-lean):  
  * Body 3, Mind 1, Soul 0\. → sum \= 4 ⇒ CL \= 1\.  
* Aether (slightly Control-lean):  
  * Control 2, Fate 1, Spirit 1\. → sum \= 4 ⇒ SL \= 1\.  
* SCL \= 2, 8 ranks \= 16 SCP.

**2.5.4.3.2 PDB & Caps**

* Violence PDB: **Blood-Forward**.  
* Influence, Revelation: **Balanced**.

Therefore:

* **Violence**:  
  * OffCap \= 4 × 2 \+ 2 \= **10**.  
  * DefCap \= 4 × 2 − 2 \= **6**.  
  * Archetypal distributions:  
    * Attack \+6, Strike 4\.  
    * Or Attack \+8, Strike 2\.  
* **Influence** & **Revelation**:  
  * OffCap \= 8, DefCap \= 8\.

---

### **2.5.4.4 Soul-Lean SCL 2 Package**

**2.5.4.4.1 Core & Aether Stats (Example)**

* Core:  
  * Body 0, Mind 1, Soul 3\. → sum \= 4 ⇒ CL \= 1\.  
* Aether:  
  * Control 1, Fate 2, Spirit 1 (social luck & destiny). → sum \= 4 ⇒ SL \= 1\.  
* SCL \= 2\.

**2.5.4.4.2 PDB & Caps**

* Influence PDB: **Blood-Forward** (weaponised social pressure).  
* Revelation: **Ward-Forward** (sanity-anchored).  
* Violence: **Balanced**.

Caps:

* **Influence**:  
  * OffCap \= 10, DefCap \= 6\.  
* **Revelation**:  
  * OffCap \= 6, DefCap \= 10\.  
* **Violence**:  
  * OffCap \= 8, DefCap \= 8\.

---

### **2.5.4.5 Mind-Lean SCL 2 Package**

**2.5.4.5.1 Core & Aether Stats (Example)**

* Core:  
  * Body 0, Mind 3, Soul 1\. → sum \= 4 ⇒ CL \= 1\.  
* Aether:  
  * Control 1, Fate 1, Spirit 2 (intuition \+ occult sense). → sum \= 4 ⇒ SL \= 1\.

**2.5.4.5.2 PDB & Caps**

* Revelation: **Blood-Forward** (offensive esoterica).  
* Influence: **Ward-Forward** (social caution).  
* Violence: **Balanced**.

Caps:

* **Revelation**: OffCap 10, DefCap 6\.  
* **Influence**: OffCap 6, DefCap 10\.  
* **Violence**: OffCap 8, DefCap 8\.

---

### **2.5.4.6 Typical SCP Budgets at SCL 2–4**

These are **guideline splits** for PC builds.

| SCL | Total SCP | Stats (Core+Aether) | Attacks & Defenses | Effects (Strike/Inf/Rev/Deb/Ward) | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2 | 60 | 16–20 | 16–20 | 20–28 | Street-level start |
| 3 | 90 | 22–30 | 24–30 | 30–40 | Elite agents / small teams |
| 4 | 120 | 30–40 | 30–40 | 40–50 | National-tier heroes / bosses |

These numbers are intended to **mirror PP growth pacing** in M\&M (≈15 PP per PL) while giving more granularity to stats and powers.

---

# **4.0 Character Creation (Numbered Flow)**

This section assumes you are building **SCL 2–4 Mortal-Tier** PCs using only the five core effects from Chapter 3.3.

## **4.1 Step One – Concept, Pillar Lean & PDB**

**4.1.1 Choose Concept**

1. Decide your **core fantasy**:  
   * Street exorcist, Gu cultivator, cursed streamer, SIDE-style agent, etc.  
2. Note:  
   * What you **fight with** (fists, Gu, law, faith, media, etc.).  
   * What you **fear losing** (body, mind, reputation, loved ones).

**4.1.2 Choose Pillar Lean**

1. Decide which pillar you are **strongest** in:  
   * Violence, Influence, or Revelation.  
2. Decide which pillar you are **most vulnerable** in.  
3. These will strongly inform:  
   * Your **Core/Aether stat allocation**.  
   * Your **Power Draws Blood** choices.

**4.1.3 Choose Power Draws Blood Profile per Pillar**

1. For **each pillar**, select one profile:  
   * **Balanced**.  
   * **Blood-Forward**.  
   * **Ward-Forward**.  
2. Record the resulting caps for each pillar using 2.5.3:  
   * Balanced: OffCap 4×SCL, DefCap 4×SCL.  
   * Blood-Forward: OffCap 4×SCL+2, DefCap 4×SCL−2.  
   * Ward-Forward: OffCap 4×SCL−2, DefCap 4×SCL+2.  
3. Briefly describe **how** power draws blood for you in each pillar:  
   * Violence (Blood track).  
   * Influence (Fate track).  
   * Revelation (Stain track).

---

## **4.2 Step Two – SCL, CL/SL & Stats**

**4.2.1 Choose SCL Band (Campaign Dial)**

1. The GM announces the **campaign SCL**:  
   * Default: **SCL 2** for starting PCs.  
   * SCL 1 for prologue / tutorial play.  
   * SCL 3–4 for more powerful campaigns.  
2. PCs normally start at:  
   * `Total SCP = 30 × SCL`.

**4.2.2 Buy Core & Aether Stats**

1. Starting from 0 in each stat (or −1 for particularly fragile concepts), buy ranks:  
   * Each \+1 rank in **Body, Mind, Soul, Control, Fate, Spirit** costs **2 SCP**.  
2. Recommended ranges:  
   * At SCL 2: total 8–10 ranks across all six stats.  
   * At SCL 3: total 11–15 ranks.  
   * At SCL 4: total 16–20 ranks.  
3. Apply your **pillar lean**:  
   * Body-lean concepts buy more **Body** and **Control**.  
   * Soul-lean concepts buy more **Soul** and **Fate**.  
   * Mind-lean concepts buy more **Mind** and **Spirit**.

**4.2.3 Derive CL, SL & Check SCL**

1. Compute:  
   * `CL = ⌊(Body + Mind + Soul) / 3⌋`.  
   * `SL = ⌊(Control + Fate + Spirit) / 3⌋`.  
   * `SCL = CL + SL`.  
2. Check against the campaign SCL:  
   * If `SCL < campaign SCL`, you may:  
     * Invest more SCP into stats, or  
     * Accept being slightly under-tier (with GM approval).  
   * If `SCL > campaign SCL`, reduce stats until `SCL` matches.

**4.2.4 Derive Pillar Traits & Caps**

1. For each pillar, define:  
   * **Attack** (Violence Attack, Influence Attack, Revelation Attack).  
   * **Defense** (Body Defense, Soul Defense, Mind Defense).  
   * **Resilience** (Body Resilience, Soul Resilience, Mind Resilience).  
2. Each \+1 rank in any of these **costs 1 SCP**.  
3. Starting guidance at SCL 2:  
   * Put **\+2 to \+4** into your main pillar’s Attack.  
   * Put **\+2 to \+4** into your main pillar’s Defense and Resilience combined.  
4. Enforce caps:  
   * For each pillar, ensure:  
     * `Attack + Effect ranks ≤ OffCap(pillar)` (2.5.3).  
     * `Defense + Resilience ≤ DefCap(pillar)` (2.5.3).  
5. If you exceed a band:  
   * Reduce either Attack or Effect rank (for offense).  
   * Reduce either Defense or Resilience (for defense).

---

## **4.3 Step Three – Spend SCP on Effects (SCL 2–4 Core)**

At SCL 2–4, the only combat effects available are:

* **Strike** (3.3.1).  
* **Influence Attack** (3.3.2).  
* **Revelation Attack** (3.3.3).  
* **Debilitate** (3.3.4).  
* **Ward** (3.3.5).

**4.3.1 Core Effect Costs**

1. Base SCP costs (per rank):  
   * Strike: **1 SCP/rank** (3.3.1.4).  
   * Influence Attack: **1 SCP/rank** (3.3.2.4).  
   * Revelation Attack: **1 SCP/rank** (3.3.3.4).  
   * Debilitate: **1 SCP/rank** (3.3.4.3).  
   * Ward: **1 SCP/rank** (3.3.5.4).  
2. Extras and Flaws modify SCP and virtual ranks as listed in 3.3.x:  
   * Extras increase SCP cost and may count as virtual ranks toward caps.  
   * Flaws reduce SCP cost but usually add strain to a track (Blood/Fate/Stain) or add limitations.

**4.3.2 Recommended Effect Investment**

1. For an SCL 2 PC:  
   * Invest **10–16 SCP** into your **primary attack effect** in your main pillar.  
   * Invest **4–8 SCP** into a **secondary attack** or Debilitate/Ward.  
   * Avoid more than **two fully ranked attacks** at SCL 2; treat third/fourth as stunts or low-rank utilities.  
2. For SCL 3–4 PCs:  
   * It becomes reasonable to:  
     * Run **two strong attacks** (primary \+ secondary pillar).  
     * Maintain **one meaningful Ward** or **control Debilitate**.

**4.3.3 Check OffCap & DefCap per Effect**

1. For each attack effect (Strike, Influence, Revelation, Debilitate):  
   * Confirm: `Attack bonus + Effect rank + virtual ranks from Extras ≤ OffCap(pillar)`.  
2. For each Ward:  
   * Confirm: `Defense + Resilience + Ward bonus ≤ DefCap(pillar)` (if you treat Ward bonus as part of Resilience for band purposes).

---

## **4.4 Step Four – Domains, Cost Tracks, Complications**

**4.4.1 Choose Domains**

1. Each PC defines **1–3 Domains**:  
   * Places, roles, or situations where their powers are strongest (e.g., *“Gu-infested ruins”*, *“courtroom & legal filings”*, *“streaming studio and channel”*).  
2. Domains:  
   * Inform **Flaws** like Anchored (3.3.5.6) or Limited: Prepared Domain (3.3.3.6).  
   * Provide GM hooks for **stakes and scenes**.

**4.4.2 Initialise Cost Tracks**

1. Each PC tracks three **cost tracks**:  
   * **Blood** (physical cost of Violence).  
   * **Fate** (social/fortune cost of Influence).  
   * **Stain** (spiritual/ontological cost of Revelation).  
2. Default maximum boxes (suggested):  
   * Base: **3 \+ SCL** boxes.  
   * If your **pillar is Blood-Forward** in that track:  
     * Add **\+2 boxes** to that track.  
   * If your pillar is Ward-Forward in that track:  
     * No extra boxes; your **cap shift** is your reward.  
3. Marking:  
   * Cost-linked Flaws (e.g., Tiring (Blood), Backlash (Stain)) explicitly mark boxes when used.  
   * When a track fills, trigger:  
     * Exhaustion, misfortune, corruption, or other major complications as defined in your long-form rules.

**4.4.3 Choose Complications**

1. Each PC chooses **2–4 Complications**, ideally:  
   * One tied to **each pillar**.  
   * One tied to their **origin / power source**.  
2. Complications:  
   * Pay out meta-currency (Fury, Clout, Insight) or GM-facing bennies when hit.  
   * Are used by the GM to **justify scene pressure** and escalate tracks.

---

## **4.5 Step Five – Finishing Touches**

**4.5.1 Gear & Minor Traits**

1. Gear is either:  
   * Purely narrative, or  
   * Built as low-rank Wards/Strikes/etc. with appropriate Flaws.  
2. Minor edges (skills, perks, contacts) can be:  
   * Bought as **fixed-cost advantages** (e.g., 1 SCP each), or  
   * Folded into Complications and Domains, depending on your final design choice.

**4.5.2 Validate Against SCL and Caps**

1. Confirm:  
   * Total SCP spent \= starting SCP (±1–2 SCP as GM-sanctioned wiggle if you allow).  
   * All pillars obey OffCap/DefCap bands after Extras/Flaws.  
   * CL, SL, SCL are properly derived.

**4.5.3 Record Sheet in Effect Notation**

1. For each attack or defense:  
   * Write it explicitly in terms of 3.3.x:  
     * e.g.,  
       “**Cinder-Fist** – Strike 4 (Brutal 1, Tiring (Blood)); see **3.3.1.5–6**.”  
     * “**Gu Nest Insight** – Revelation Attack 5 (Echoing, Backlash (Stain)); see **3.3.3.5–6**.”  
2. This ensures stat blocks for PCs and bosses can directly reference the SRD.

---

## **4.6 Hook Back to Examples (Gu Patriarch & PCs)**

You already have worked examples (Gu Cult Patriarch boss \+ three SCL 2 PCs). When you revisit them:

1. **Re-express Powers in 3.3.x Notation**  
   * For the Patriarch:  
     * Make each phase’s main attacks explicit:  
       * e.g.,  
         “**Stage 1 Revelation** – *Nest of Gu Eyes*: Revelation Attack 6 (Echoing 1, Contagious Insight 1, Backlash (Stain)); see 3.3.3.5–6.”  
       * “**Stage 2 Violence** – *Gu-Swollen Body*: Strike 8 (Area 1, Brutal 1, Tiring (Blood)); see 3.3.1.5–6.”  
   * For the PCs:  
     * Ensure each core move is a named Strike/Influence/Revelation/Debilitate/Ward with rule references.  
2. **Annotate Caps in Stat Blocks**  
   * Example annotations:  
     * “Violence OffBand: Attack \+6, Strike 4 \= 10 (≤ OffCap 10, Blood-Forward; see 2.5.3.3).”  
     * “Revelation DefBand: Mind Defense \+3, Mind Resilience \+3, Ward \+2 \= 8 (≤ DefCap 8, Balanced).”  
3. **Check SCL & SCP**  
   * For each example PC:  
     * Confirm they spend **60 SCP at SCL 2**, with stat allocations within the ranges in 2.5.4.  
   * For the Patriarch:  
     * Use the same ladder (e.g., SCL 5 \= 150 SCP baseline) but exceed PC budgets deliberately, as you planned in the Boss Design workbook.

---

If you want, the next move after this would be:

* A short **4.7 “Quick Build” section** that turns the above into a 7-step checklist (for players),  
* And a parallel **“Boss Build Checklist”** that mirrors those steps from the GM side while explicitly calling out the 150–350% power scaling bands you’ve already defined.

Below are the next two pieces of the “core spine” in SRD style:

* **4.7 Quick Build (Player-Facing 7-Step Checklist)**  
* **6.3 Boss Build Checklist (GM-Facing, 150–350% scaling)**

You can drop these into your draft and renumber later if needed.

---

# **4.7 Quick Build (Player-Facing Checklist)**

Use this when you want to build an SCL 2–4 PC in one sitting without flipping between sections.

## **4.7.1 Seven-Step Character Build Procedure**

**4.7.1.1 Step 1 – Concept & Pillar Lean**

1. Choose a **high-level concept**:  
   * Examples: *Gu Street Exorcist*, *Cursed Technique Brawler*, *Ratings Witch*, *SIDE-style Operative*.  
2. Decide which **pillar** you are:  
   * **Best at** (Violence / Influence / Revelation).  
   * **Most vulnerable in**.  
3. Write a one-line statement:  
   * “I win by… \[Violence / Influence / Revelation\].”  
   * “I break when… \[Violence / Influence / Revelation\] hits me.”

---

**4.7.1.2 Step 2 – Power Draws Blood Profile (PDB)**

1. For **each pillar**, pick one profile (see 2.5.3.3):  
   * **Balanced** (even OffCap/DefCap).  
   * **Blood-Forward** (higher OffCap, lower DefCap).  
   * **Ward-Forward** (lower OffCap, higher DefCap).  
2. Record your bands for each pillar:  
   * Balanced:  
     `OffCap = 4 × SCL`, `DefCap = 4 × SCL`.  
   * Blood-Forward:  
     `OffCap = 4 × SCL + 2`, `DefCap = 4 × SCL − 2`.  
   * Ward-Forward:  
     `OffCap = 4 × SCL − 2`, `DefCap = 4 × SCL + 2`.  
3. In one sentence per pillar, explain **how power draws blood**:  
   * Violence → Blood track (physical costs).  
   * Influence → Fate track (entanglements, debts, PR fallout).  
   * Revelation → Stain track (corruption, cosmic residue).

---

**4.7.1.3 Step 3 – Choose SCL and Buy Stats**

1. The GM announces the **campaign SCL**:  
   * Default starting game: **SCL 2** (≈ PL 4 in M\&M).  
2. You get **Total SCP \= 30 × SCL** (e.g., 60 SCP at SCL 2).  
3. Buy **Core & Aether stats** (Body, Mind, Soul, Control, Fate, Spirit):  
   * Start at 0 in each.  
   * Each \+1 rank costs **2 SCP**.  
   * At SCL 2, aim for 8–10 total ranks (≈16–20 SCP).  
4. Derive:  
   * `CL = ⌊(Body + Mind + Soul) / 3⌋`.  
   * `SL = ⌊(Control + Fate + Spirit) / 3⌋`.  
   * `SCL = CL + SL`.  
5. If your SCL is off the campaign SCL:  
   * Increase or reduce stats until they match, or ask the GM if they allow slightly under-tier builds.

---

**4.7.1.4 Step 4 – Buy Pillar Traits (Attack / Defense / Resilience)**

1. For each pillar:  
   * Violence → **Violence Attack**, **Body Defense**, **Body Resilience**.  
   * Influence → **Influence Attack**, **Soul Defense**, **Soul Resilience**.  
   * Revelation → **Revelation Attack**, **Mind Defense**, **Mind Resilience**.  
2. Each \+1 rank in Attack, Defense, or Resilience costs **1 SCP**.  
3. At SCL 2:  
   * Put **\+2 to \+4** into your **main pillar’s Attack**.  
   * Put **\+2 to \+4** total into your main pillar’s Defense \+ Resilience.  
   * Keep off-pillars at **0–2** in Attack and **1–3** in Defense/Resilience.  
4. Check caps for each pillar:  
   * Offense band: `Attack + Effect ranks + virtual ranks ≤ OffCap(pillar)`.  
   * Defense band: `Defense + Resilience ≤ DefCap(pillar)`.  
5. If you fail a band:  
   * Lower Attack or Effect (for offense),  
   * Or lower Defense or Resilience (for defense).

---

**4.7.1.5 Step 5 – Choose 2–3 Signature Effects**

1. Pick **at least one core attack effect** in your main pillar:  
   * **Strike** (3.3.1) for Violence.  
   * **Influence Attack** (3.3.2) for Influence.  
   * **Revelation Attack** (3.3.3) for Revelation.  
2. Optionally add:  
   * 1 **Debilitate** (3.3.4) to control foes, or  
   * 1 **Ward** (3.3.5) to protect yourself or allies.  
3. Buy ranks:  
   * Base: **1 SCP per rank** for all five core effects (3.3.x cost entries).  
4. Add **1–3 Extras/Flaws**:  
   * Extras (e.g., Area, Brutal, Echoing, Aura): more SCP, sometimes virtual ranks.  
   * Flaws (e.g., Tiring (Blood), Backlash (Stain), Limited Domain): fewer SCP, but add real risks.  
5. Re-check OffCap:  
   * Add up: `Attack + Effect rank + virtual ranks from Extras`.  
   * Adjust until it fits the OffCap of the appropriate pillar.

**4.7.1.6 Step 6 – Domains, Cost Tracks & Complications**

1. Choose **1–3 Domains**:  
   * Examples: *“Gu-Infested Ruins”*, *“Courtroom & Legal Filings”*, *“Haunted Network Studio”*.  
   * Tag at least one effect with an **Anchored** or **Limited: Prepared Domain** Flaw if appropriate.  
2. Set **cost tracks**:  
   * Base max \= `3 + SCL` boxes in **Blood**, **Fate**, **Stain**.  
   * If a pillar is **Blood-Forward**, you may add **\+2 boxes** to that pillar’s track (table option; if used, note in rules).  
3. Pick **2–4 Complications**:  
   * At least one per pillar if possible.  
   * These fuel meta-currency (Fury, Clout, Insight) and give the GM license to hit you where it hurts.

---

**4.7.1.7 Step 7 – Finish the Character**

1. Name, appearance, power descriptors, and signature move names.  
2. Gear and minor edges:  
   * Either purely narrative, or purchased as low-rank effects with appropriate Flaws.  
3. Final validation:  
   * Total SCP spent \= starting SCP.  
   * SCL matches campaign SCL.  
   * OffCap/DefCap obeyed in all pillars.  
4. Write each power in SRD notation:  
   * e.g.,  
     “**Cinder-Fist** – Strike 4 (Accurate, Brutal 1, Tiring (Blood)); see **3.3.1.5–6**.”  
     “**Ratings Curse** – Influence Attack 3 (Mass Audience 1, Lingering Rumor 1, Traceable); see **3.3.2.5–6**.”

# **6.3 Boss Build Checklist (GM-Facing)**

This mirrors the PC Quick Build but for **Nemeses, Bosses, and Major Threats**, using the 150–350% scaling bands you established.

Mutants & Masterminds treats NPCs more loosely than PCs: villains aren’t required to obey PP budgets as strictly, and may exceed the heroes’ PL or have more points, as long as their **trait caps** are set to an appropriate PL.  
This checklist keeps that spirit but grounds it in your SCL/SCP framework.

---

## **6.3.1 Step 1 – Role & Rank**

**6.3.1.1 Define Narrative Role**

1. Decide what the boss is **for in the story**:  
   * Early mini-boss / tutorial menace.  
   * Season mid-boss.  
   * Season finale Nemesis.  
   * Endgame / campaign “Patriarch”-level threat.  
2. Decide whether the boss is:  
   * Solo focus (1 enemy vs party).  
   * Boss plus **minions**.  
   * Boss plus **elite lieutenants**.

**6.3.1.2 Choose Boss Rank (1–5)**

You can use a **5-rank ladder** for consistency:

| Rank | Band (vs party SCP) | Typical Use Case |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | ≈ 150% | Tough lieutenant / mini-boss |
| 2 | ≈ 175% | Strong lieutenant / early season boss |
| 3 | ≈ 200–225% | Standard “season boss” |
| 4 | ≈ 250–300% | Major Nemesis (multi-stage) |
| 5 | ≈ 300–350% | Apex Nemesis (multi-stage \+ support) |

*   
  These ratios echo M\&M’s practice of giving **master villains higher PL** or more PP than PCs, while still keeping them beatable by a team.

---

## **6.3.2 Step 2 – SCL & SCP Budget for Boss**

**6.3.2.1 Compute Party Budget**

1. Let the party have:  
   * **N PCs**, each at **SCL\_pc** with SCP\_pc \= `30 × SCL_pc`.  
2. Party SCP pool:  
   * `SCP_party = Σ SCP_pc`.

Example: 3 PCs at SCL 2:

* Each: 60 SCP.  
* `SCP_party = 180`.

**6.3.2.2 Choose Boss SCP by Rank**

Use the Rank band chosen at 6.3.1.2:

1. **Boss SCP**:  
   * `SCP_boss ≈ SCP_party × RankFactor`, where:  
     * Rank 1: 1.5×.  
     * Rank 2: 1.75×.  
     * Rank 3: 2.0–2.25×.  
     * Rank 4: 2.5–3.0×.  
     * Rank 5: 3.0–3.5×.  
2. This is a **guideline**, not a hard rule:  
   * Like M\&M, you may ignore strict “point parity” for NPCs when it serves the story, as long as their *trait caps* map cleanly to SCL.

**6.3.2.3 Choose Boss SCL**

1. Decide if the boss’s **SCL** is:  
   * Equal to the PCs’ SCL (boss wins through broader SCP and better builds), or  
   * \+1 SCL above (PL-equivalent \+2), which M\&M uses as a common “master villain vs heroes” setup.  
2. Example for a 3×SCL2 party:  
   * Rank 1–2 boss: **SCL 2–3**.  
   * Rank 3–4 boss: **SCL 3–4**.  
   * Rank 5 boss: **SCL 4–5**.  
3. Once you pick SCL\_boss:  
   * Treat its **trait caps** exactly like a PC (OffCap/DefCap from 2.5.3).  
   * Let **SCP\_boss** exceed a same-SCL PC’s SCP as per Rank (this is how bosses get more breadth and redundancy).

---

## **6.3.3 Step 3 – PDB Profile & Domains**

**6.3.3.1 Choose Boss PDB per Pillar**

1. Decide which pillar is the boss’s **primary weapon**:  
   * Violence for physical monsters, martial demigods.  
   * Influence for political entities, cult leaders, media demons.  
   * Revelation for sanity-breakers, cosmic entities, high-tier Gu Patriarchs.  
2. For the **primary pillar**, almost always choose:  
   * **Blood-Forward** (high OffCap, low DefCap),  
   * Combined with **strong Ward** or minions to keep the boss alive.  
3. For secondary pillars:  
   * Use Balanced or Ward-Forward depending on theme:  
     * Example: Patriarch is **Revelation Blood-Forward**, **Violence Ward-Forward** in the first stage.

**6.3.3.2 Define Boss Domains**

1. Give the boss **1–3 Domains**:  
   * Physical lair (Gu Shaft, Temple, Network Server Farm).  
   * Social sphere (Cult, Corporation, Faction).  
   * Mystical context (Dream Realm, Cursed Broadcast, Ritual Circle).  
2. Attach Flaws like **Anchored** or **Limited: Prepared Domain** to powerful effects:  
   * These give built-in “take away the lair” hooks for PCs.

---

## **6.3.4 Step 4 – Allocate SCP (Stats, Traits, Effects)**

**6.3.4.1 Boss Stats (CL / SL / SCL)**

1. Spend a fraction of **SCP\_boss** on Core \+ Aether stats:  
   * Typically **25–35%** of SCP\_boss.  
   * Bosses are often more **extreme** than PCs:  
     * One or two stats can be **very high** (e.g., Mind 6, Spirit 6).  
2. Derive CL, SL, SCL as if for a PC:  
   * This ensures trait caps are coherent.

**6.3.4.2 Boss Pillar Traits**

1. Give the boss:  
   * One **primary Attack** in their signature pillar **near or at OffCap**.  
   * One **secondary Attack** in a second pillar (often slightly under-cap).  
   * Strong **Defenses/Resilience** in at least one pillar (often Ward-Forward).  
2. Rough guideline:  
   * 25–30% of SCP\_boss spent on Attacks/Def/Resilience.  
   * The rest on signature **Effects** and **stage mechanics**.

**6.3.4.3 Boss Effects**

1. Build **2–4 signature effects** at minimum, using 3.3.x:  
   * A main Strike / Influence / Revelation attack.  
   * One Debilitate for control.  
   * One or two Wards or “Domain effects.”  
2. For bosses, lean on:  
   * Area, Echoing, Contagious Insight, Aura, Hardened, and cost-track Flaws (Tiring, Backlash).  
3. Let bosses carry **more Extras** than PCs:  
   * This is how you express their “theme and flexibility” without pushing trait caps too far.

---

## **6.3.5 Step 5 – Stages & Break Points**

**6.3.5.1 Decide Number of Stages**

1. By Rank:  
   * Rank 1–2 bosses: **1 stage**.  
   * Rank 3 bosses: **1–2 stages**.  
   * Rank 4–5 bosses: **2–3 stages**.  
2. Each stage can:  
   * Shift PDB profiles (e.g., Revelation → Violence focus).  
   * Change Domains or move scenes.  
   * Alter which effects are active.

**6.3.5.2 Define Stage Transitions**

1. Common triggers:  
   * Boss reaches **50% or 25% HP / track thresholds**.  
   * Boss maxes out a **cost track** (Blood/Fate/Stain).  
   * PCs disrupt a Domain (destroy Gu jars, break a ritual).  
2. At the moment of transition:  
   * Change one or more:  
     * PDB profile in a pillar.  
     * Active Ward rank/target.  
     * Attack focus (swap from Revelation Attack to Strike, etc.).  
   * Optionally refresh or alter minions and terrain.

---

## **6.3.6 Step 6 – Minions, Elites & Environment**

**6.3.6.1 Minions**

1. Minions are built as:  
   * **SCL −1 or 0 equivalents**,  
   * Or “stat-only” NPCs with Off/Def bands well below PCs.  
2. You do **not** need full SCP accounting for minions:  
   * Follow M\&M guidance: mooks are **below PL and PP guidelines**, used for narrative texture, not fair fights.

**6.3.6.2 Elites**

1. Elites sit between PCs and Boss:  
   * SCL equal to PCs but with limited SCP (≈75–100% of a PC).  
   * Or slightly below boss’s SCL with more focused builds.  
2. Use **one main attack \+ one trick** per elite to keep complexity manageable.

**6.3.6.3 Environment Hazards**

1. Add **1–3 environmental threats** keyed to the boss’s pillar:  
   * Falling Gu jars (Violence), panic crowds (Influence), hallucination zones (Revelation).  
2. Simple method:  
   * Treat each hazard as a rank 2–4 Strike, Debilitate, or Revelation Attack with a low Attack bonus but auto-trigger conditions (e.g., “end of round” checks).

---

## **6.3.7 Step 7 – Sanity Check & Tag with Rules**

**6.3.7.1 Check SCL & Bands**

1. Ensure boss SCL and caps:  
   * `Attack + Effect + virtual ranks ≤ OffCap(pillar)` for each pillar.  
   * `Defense + Resilience (+ Ward bonus) ≤ DefCap(pillar)` when fully buffed.  
2. If the boss wildly outstrips these:  
   * Either **raise SCL\_boss**, or  
   * Note explicitly that this is a “mythic/immortal” entity, not a fair mortal boss.

**6.3.7.2 Check SCP Ratio vs Party**

1. Compare SCP\_boss to SCP\_party:  
   * Should fall in the **Rank band** chosen (150–350%).  
2. If ratio is too high:  
   * Remove a stage or some Extras.  
3. If ratio is too low:  
   * Add Wards, minions, or environment elements.

**6.3.7.3 Tag All Powers with SRD References**

1. In the stat block, write each effect with its reference:  
   * “**Nest of Gu Eyes** – Revelation Attack 6 (Echoing, Contagious Insight, Backlash (Stain)); see 3.3.3.5–6.”  
   * “**Cinder-Limb Pulverise** – Strike 8 (Area 1, Brutal 1, Tiring (Blood)); see 3.3.1.5–6.”  
2. Note any **stage triggers** and **cost track thresholds**:  
   * “At Stain ≥ 6, transition to Stage 2 (see 6.3.5.2).”

If you’d like to continue, the next logical pieces to draft in the same style are:

* A **4.8 Player Quick Reference** (“All the numbers you choose at chargen, on one page”), and  
* A **GM Boss Template Appendix** with 2–3 fully written sample bosses (including the Gu Cult Patriarch) using this checklist end-to-end.
