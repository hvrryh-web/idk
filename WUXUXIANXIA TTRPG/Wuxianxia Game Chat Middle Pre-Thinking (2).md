Planning for game design and system balancing

The user wants mechanical design, so I’ll focus on system message guidance. I'll reference Champions and M\&M correctly, considering their cost structures. I need to draft suggested stat spreads and base costs for effects like Strike and Debilitate, ensuring balance with proper references and cost consistency.

Following system and development instructions for tools

I need to follow the system message which says to use web.run for queries that can benefit from it, and I should also check local files like the "\[M\&M 3e\] Masterdoc" for Aranth-specific rules. I'll call web.run for M\&M/Champions stats and file\_search for Aranth-specific house rules.

Crafting next step in SRD design

I need to proceed with crafting the SRD piece for "SCL 2 Character Budget." Now, I should include a table with total SCP and recommended allocation, following previous assumptions of 60 SCP per SCL 2\. I’ll confirm that this maps well with PL 4 and M\&M’s PL 4 60PP.

Refining SCL 2 Character Budget and effect costs

In M\&M, a PL 4 hero uses 60PP, which aligns with 60 SCP for SCL 2\. I'll draft a distribution, aiming for something like 20/10/30 for Body/Mind/Soul, Control/Fate/Spirit, and secondaries. For effect costs, I’ll stick to 1 SCP per simple effect rank, aligning with M\&M standards for damage, attack, and defenses.

Determining cost for effects and extras/flaws

Core stats cost 2 SCP per rank, and they include combinations like Attack+Resilience. For base effect costs, Strike, Influence Attack, and Revelation Attack will be 1 SCP per rank due to balance. Debilitate might be 1.5 SCP or a bit more due to its flexibility. For extras and flaws, I’ll adapt from M\&M and Champions, keeping things simple yet flexible.

Finalizing combat system and integrating FS and Champions elements

The user asked for the final base costs for various effects but didn’t specifically ask for the Flexibility Score (FS) thresholds, so I’ll just note it briefly in the details. I’ll ensure the answer is clean and focused on the SRD of the combat system, using Patriarch and PCs as consistent examples. Additionally, I’ll mention the “Power Draws Blood” limitation in the context of extras/flaws.

Designing SCL 2 budgets with Aranth rules

We’ve got the context for M\&M/Champions: PL 10 being around 150 PP and Champions starting with 400 points. Now, I need to design the SCL 2 budgets and costs, while integrating Aranth's house

Refining SCP budget and stat spread for SCL 2

I’ll reference the existing “Wuxianxia Game.docx” for the foundational mapping and analysis already written, specifically the SCL 2 \= 60 SCP. I’ll take the distribution guidance from the Aranth Character Guide as inspiration, proposing a refined spread for stats, defenses, and powers based on this 60 SCP budget, tailoring it for a balanced hero.

Finalizing SCL 2 budget and stat spreads

I have most of the information, so now I need to finalize the SCL 2 budget and the suggested stat spreads. I’ve identified the baseline allocation in the Wuxianxia doc (24 SCP for Core \+ Aether), but I need to pull the rest of the information from the document to ensure a complete, well-rounded distribution.

Finalizing SCL 2 stats and powers allocation

At SCL 2 with 60 SCP, here's the breakdown:

* 24 SCP for Core \+ Aether, splitting between 6 core and 6 aether ranks.  
* 16-18 SCP for secondary traits (defenses, attacks, skills), keeping balance with half of the budget in stats/traits.  
* 20 SCP for powers like Strike and Debilitate.

This leaves 6 SCP for skills and perks.

Proposing stat spreads for SCL 2 characters

For a simple SRD spread: 24 SCP to Core/Aether, 18 SCP to powers, 12 SCP to traits, and 6 SCP to skills/perks seems reasonable. For SCL 2 characters, I can also propose stat spreads for Body-lean, Mind-lean, and Soul-lean builds based on examples.

Core stats should balance across Body, Mind, and Soul; the examples suggest 4 key points for flexibility. But there's a discrepancy with the "14 SCP" allocation in the doc—seems like some recalculation is needed.

Clarifying Core vs. Primary stat allocation

There was a mix-up in how the costs were attributed. The final allocation notes that Core/Aether costs 2 SCP per rank and primary stats cost 1 SCP each. The confusion arises from treating Body as either purchased or derived, which affects the final breakdown between Core and primary stats. We’ll need to decide how to treat these variations for final character builds.

Clarifying Core vs. Aether cost structure

Section 7.2 says Core stats are derived, meaning the cost is applied to primaries, not to Core itself. However, it also mentions that Core/Aether rank costs 2 SCP, which might not align — perhaps "Aether" was labeled as purchased while "Core" is derived. A quick review of section 7.2 will clarify whether Body/Mind/Soul are purchasable or derived.

Resolving the contradiction between Core and primaries

The document initially defines Core as derived from primaries and not purchased, but later contradicts this by suggesting costs for Core/Aether ranks. To resolve the conflict, we assume that primary stats cost 1 SCP per rank and Aether costs 2 SCP, with Core being derived from primary stats, not bought separately. So the SCL is worked out from Core and Aether values.

Clarifying the pricing for SCL 2 budgets

The design suggests Core/Aether ranks cost 2 SCP each, but this seems ambiguous. We can treat Aether as 2 SCP and primaries as 1 SCP each, giving double value, especially as primary stats feed Core. To keep things balanced and in line with similar systems, we'll make primary ranks cost 2 SCP and Aether 2 SCP without directly costing Core ranks.

Setting limits for SCL 2 SCP budgets

To maintain balance, we can't let players spend all points on primary stats. We'll adopt the Wuxianxia doc's rule: secondary stats and traits cost 1 SCP per rank, with powers costing 1 per rank. For clarity, we propose a final scheme where primary stats and Aether cost 2 SCP per rank, and attacks/defenses/effects cost 1 per rank. We also suggest a standard array: Body1, Mind1, Soul1; Control1, Fate1, Spirit1, keeping SCL2 budgets at 60 SCP. Alternative stat spreads can still be presented.

Refining SCL 2 SCP budget and stat spreads

The total SCP cost for 6 primaries at 2 each (12) and 3 Aethers at 2 each (6) is 18, leaving 42 for other stats. To reflect varied PC builds, we can allow players to buy primaries above 1\. A suggested stat spread: Body1, Mind1, Soul1; Control1, Fate1, Spirit1, costing approximately 24 SCP.

Aligning Core/Aether and Primary attribute pricing

Since the document suggests Core and Aether stats cost at 2 SCP per rank, I’m considering unifying them while possibly using primaries as derived stats. The user asked how to assign values to Core stats, so I propose: Core stats (like Body, Mind, Soul) cost 2, and primary attributes cost 1 each, supporting skills and specific actions.

Clarifying the Core, Aether, and stat pricing

To minimize confusion, I'll focus on Core, Aether, and pillar stats in the current explanation, since the user already reviewed Attributes and Core stats in a previous report. The design specifies: Core and Aether at 2 SCP each, while primary/secondary attributes (the 9 stats) cost 1 each. This helps to unify concepts and avoid contradictions.

Finalizing SCL2 budgets and stat spreads

For SCL2, I'll focus primarily on Core (Body, Mind, Soul) and Aether (Control, Fate, Spirit) stats. I'll use the 24/36/60 SCP split while adopting a simple design: Core and Aether stats cost 2 SCP per rank, while the nine attributes are descriptive and not mechanical. I'm ensuring that the 12 ranks, total SCP, and constraints align with the user’s "Balanced" spread request.

Adjusting SCL2 budget design and costs

For SCL2, we aim for balanced stats like CL1 SL1 (8-10 ranks, 16-20 SCP for core/aether). But we can allow different distributions like CL2 SL0 (Body-biased) with 6-8 ranks and 0-2 in Aether (20 SCP). We'll suggest approximate budget ranges for flexibility, focusing on starting characters’ builds and going with variable stat spreads.

Finalizing effect costs and pillar-based options

We’ve got the extras and flaws accounting sorted for key effects (Strike and Debilitate). For extra clarity, we’ll apply Blood-Forward and Ward-Forward options linked to power costs, offering a 10% discount on a specific pillar’s powers. The goal is simplicity while aligning with the user’s desired customization and trade-offs for offensive/defensive balancing.

Drafting SCL2 SCP Budget and Stat Spreads

Organizing response structure

I need to synthesize the content in moderate detail, aiming for a clear structure. The response should be detailed but not excessive—around 2,000–3,000 words. I'll focus on new content related to SCL2 budgets and effect costs, and avoid restating previous information while keeping it appropriately detailed.

Structuring stat spreads and effect costs

The response will include suggested stat spreads for Balanced, Body, Soul, and Mind with Core/Aether values and samples. Then, I'll explore core effect costs for each effect type (Strike, Debilitate, etc.). I'll detail base costs, resistances, durations, extras, flaws, and relevant stats, referencing specific tests for accuracy, like using the Patriarch and SCL2 PCs.

Estimating offense and effect costs for characters

For a Body-focused character like Cinder-Fist, we can estimate attack and effect costs. Let's use a simple model where the net attack and effect ranks combined reflect the SCP. Maintaining consistency in cost calculations is crucial—noting that attack modifiers and effect ranks each cost 1 SCP per rank. For the Patriarch, at SCL5, this logic holds for attack effects.

Defining effect costs and structure

For effects, setting the base cost to 1 per rank works well. I can combine Strike, Influence Attack, and Revelation Attack into one unified effect, though they may be kept separate if needed. Ward adds to resilience or defense, with a base cost of 1 per rank. Debilitate, as a debuff, involves assigning specific tracks and limitations.

Defining Debilitate effects and costs

For Debilitate, a 3-step progression works: 1st degree causes slight penalties, 2nd degree heavier penalties, and 3rd degree leads to being downed or shattered. I’ll set various extras (Prolonged, Multi-target) and flaws (Limited Degree, Side Effect). We'll emphasize cost tracks with "Tiring" as a common flaw to simplify while maintaining balance.

Simplifying SCL2 Budget Breakdown and Cost Mods

For the simplified core effects, we can treat extra costs as follows: \+1 per rank for Attack and Defensive extras. For Tiring, it’s \-1 flat or per rank but never dropping below 0.5 per rank. Though fractional handling is tricky, we can apply a "half rank per SCP" rule for complex cases.

Next, I plan to craft the SCL2 budget breakdown and ensure to cite relevant sources.

Outlining Core Attacks and Ward Effects

For core combat effects, terms like Strike, Influence Attack, and Revelation Attack follow a straightforward cost system, typically 1 SCP per rank. We define attacks by their pillar—Violence, Influence, or Revelation—with specific resistances like Body, Soul, or Mind. I’ve included costs for conditions like Tiring, with appropriate extras and flaws, depending on their nature. We'll also detail Ward subtypes, like Body, Soul, or Mind, as defensive effects.
