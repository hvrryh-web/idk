I have reviewed the document's Phase 2 decisions and Phase 3 proposals for the Wuxianxia game design. The system establishes a robust framework by integrating a hidden Power Level cap (SCL) with a three-pillar conflict system (Violence, Influence, Revelation).

However, by using the **Champions Point-Buy System** philosophy as inspiration—which is fundamentally based on modifying a power's cost with Advantages and Limitations—I can suggest a few key structural improvements that tie the "Power Draws Blood" narrative more deeply into the character build economy.

Here are the suggested improvements to address potential design gaps, outlined with a focus on **structural point-buy incentives**.Design Gaps and Suggested Improvements

| Gap/Flaw | Wuxianxia Design (Current State) | Champions Point-Buy Inspiration | Suggested Improvement |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. Cost Tracks are a Tax, Not an Investment** | The "Power Draws Blood" (PDB) profiles (**Blood-Forward/Ward-Forward**) and Cost Tracks (**Blood, Fate, Stain**) are consequences. They are a *tax* for using higher-end power but do not offer an **upfront build discount** for accepting them. | In the Champions system, a Power's Base Cost is reduced by Limitations (e.g., Side Effects, Unreliable) to get its Real Cost. Players are *incentivized* to take flaws for a cheaper, stronger character. | **Integrate Cost Tracks as Build Limitations (Disadvantages):** The **Blood-Forward** (+2 Offense/-2 Defense) and **Ward-Forward** (+2 Defense/-2 Offense) profiles should grant a **10-20% Point Discount** in addition to the cap shift. This makes the character structurally dependent on their flaws and encourages players to choose a high-risk profile to maximize their power budget. |
| **2\. Redundant Level Mapping** | The mathematical mapping between Core Level (CL), Soul Level (SL), Soul Core Level (SCL), and Sequence Rank (Seq) is complex (`Seq ≈ SCL` and both are derived from averages). While it provides flavor, it offers little structural consequence beyond setting a simple cap. | Champions allows for greater power efficiency when buying abilities that align with a character’s theme (e.g., Martial Arts attacks being cheaper for a martial artist). | **Give CL/SL Unique Structural Benefits:** Make CL and SL **competing resources** that alter the cost of certain powers: \<ul\>\<li\>If **CL \> SL** (Focus on Body/Mind), all **Violence/Influence** powers receive a **5% cost reduction** (Advantage equivalent).\</li\>\<li\>If **SL \> CL** (Focus on Soul/Aether), all **Revelation** powers receive a **10% cost reduction** or a free **Advantage** (e.g., "Always Targets Soul Defense").\</li\>\</ul\> This makes the character's CL/SL split a meaningful build choice tied to power cost, not just a cap calculation. |
| **3\. High-Risk/High-Reward Powers are Simply Banned** | The document lists "Removed or rewritten" effects (Metamorph, broad Transform, Luck Control) as simply "Broken" and bans them. This removes high-cost, high-flexibility options. | Champions' strength is in defining all effects generically (e.g., *N-Damage*) and using **Advantages** (extra cost) and **Limitations** (cost reduction) to dial power. Banned effects are simply effects with too many Advantages and no Limitations. | **Formalize a Cost Modifier for Flexibility/Power:** Replace the flat "ban list" with a **Point Cost Multiplier Cap**. For instance: \<ul\>\<li\>Define a Power's **Flexibility Score** based on its total number of Advantages (e.g., Area, Selective, Continuous).\</li\>\<li\>Powers with a Flexibility Score above a certain threshold (**\+200% Total Advantage**) are only purchasable if the player takes an equal amount of **Limitation Cost Reductions** (e.g., *Must Mark Stain* or *Requires Full Scene Activation*).\</li\>\</ul\>This keeps powerful effects in the game as **Story-Heavy, Highly-Limited** abilities, fulfilling the "power always has a cost" motif structurally. |
