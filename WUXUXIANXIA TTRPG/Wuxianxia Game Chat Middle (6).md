    * You suffer or risk serious Violence conditions.  
    * You take reckless melee actions that hit Complications.  
* Suggested usage:  
  * Spend Fury to **Push the Limits** on Violence (temporarily raise OffCap by \+2 for one attack, then mark \+1 Blood).  
  * Use Fury rerolls on key Strikes that would decide a fight.

---

# **5.3 Example Influence Scene – “Trending War with the Angel of Ratings”**

A short, Influence-heavy scenario seed using the **Angel of Ratings** (Appendix A.2).

## **5.3.1 Premise**

The PCs’ last operation was recorded and posted. The **Angel of Ratings** is turning the footage into a trending narrative that paints them as villains. They must fight a **social battle** to reclaim their story before city authorities and public opinion turn fully against them.

---

## **5.3.2 Scene Setup**

1. **Stakes**  
   * Success: PCs **neutralise the smear campaign**, retain or gain a positive public image, possibly stealing some of the Angel’s audience.  
   * Failure: PCs are **Discredited or Isolated** in key social Domains; police and factions treat them as unstable vigilantes.  
2. **Clocks**  
   * **“Public Sympathy” (6 segments)** – if filled by PCs, the public sides with them.  
   * **“Angel’s Narrative” (6 segments)** – if filled by the Angel, the smear sticks.  
   * Optional: **“Authority Response” (4 segments)** – fills passively; if filled, the police/Govt step in hard.  
3. **Initial Positions**  
   * PCs start “on the back foot”:  
     * “Angel’s Narrative” starts with **2 segments already filled**.  
   * PCs who are naturally public-facing (Ratings Witch, etc.) might add **1 free segment** to “Public Sympathy.”

---

## **5.3.3 Play Procedure**

1. Each PC’s turn:  
   * Take a **social action** framed as:  
     * Public statement, counterstream, public service, exposing the Angel, etc.  
   * Make an **Influence Attack** (3.3.2) against:  
     * A specific **faction clock** (e.g., “Public Sympathy”), or  
     * The Angel’s **social shields** (Soul Defense / Soul Resilience).  
2. On a hit:  
   * Apply Rattled/Discredited/Isolated to key NPCs, **and** mark progress on relevant clocks.  
3. PCs can:  
   * Use **Debilitate (Influence)** to gag or censure the Angel’s spokespeople.  
   * Use **Soul Ward** on themselves or allies at risk of being Discredited.

---

## **5.3.4 Clout & Fate in the Scene**

1. PCs earn **Clout** when:  
   * They lean into Complications (e.g., admitting fault, confronting personal pasts live on stream).  
   * They accept risky social gambles (e.g., letting the Angel set the terms of a live debate).  
2. PCs can spend **Clout** to:  
   * Gain \+3 or advantage on key Influence rolls.  
   * **Spin the Narrative**: introduce prior relationships (“I worked with this journalist”) for advantage.  
3. **Fate Track**:  
   * Each time PCs **lie brazenly**, break deals live, or burn bridges:  
     * The GM marks **\+1 Fate**.  
   * At Fate Strain:  
     * Social rolls become harder; **Angel’s Narrative** clock may advance each round.  
   * At Fate Overflow:  
     * A major twist: an ally betrays the PCs on air, or an old scandal resurfaces.

---

## **5.3.5 Resolution**

* PCs succeed if:  
  * They fill **Public Sympathy** and keep **Angel’s Narrative** under threshold.  
* Consequences:  
  * On success: Clout gains, positive Domain (“Sympathetic Audience”), possibly a backlash against the Angel.  
  * On failure: Discredited/Isolated conditions, new Complications (“Infamous Vigilantes”), and advancement of long-term Fate clocks.

---

# **5.4 Example Revelation Scene – “Through the Gu Hive’s Eyes”**

A Revelation-heavy scenario seed using the **Gu Cult Patriarch** (Appendix A.1).

## **5.4.1 Premise**

To stop the Gu Cult Patriarch, the PCs must understand how the **Hive thinks**. The only way to gain this knowledge is to **delve into a Gu-Infested Domain** and willingly share perspective with the hive-mind.

---

## **5.4.2 Scene Setup**

1. **Mystery Questions**  
   * What does the Hive want?  
   * Where is the true **Nest of Gu Eyes** located?  
   * What will the Patriarch do if cornered?  
2. **Clocks**  
   * **“Understand the Hive’s Pattern” (8 segments)** – PC progress.  
   * **“Hive’s Claim on Minds” (6 segments)** – threat; fills as PCs expose themselves.  
3. **Environment**  
   * Shifting tunnels, whispering Gu jars, visions of other victims.

---

## **5.4.3 Play Procedure**

1. PCs explore and interact:  
   * Examine Gu, read carvings, listen to whispers, meditate in hive chambers.  
2. To gain meaningful progress, PCs must:  
   * Make Mind-based investigative checks, or  
   * Submit to **Revelation Attacks** (either environmental or voluntarily triggered).  
3. When a PC submits to **Nest-like Revelation**:  
   * Treat as Revelation Attack (3.3.3) from the Domain:  
     * Attack vs Mind Defense, save vs `10 + rank`.  
   * On failure:  
     * Apply **Shaken/Haunted/Deranged**, and mark **Stain**.  
     * Advance **“Understand the Hive’s Pattern”** by 1–2 segments.

---

## **5.4.4 Insight & Stain in the Scene**

1. PCs earn **Insight** when:  
   * They accept Revelation Attacks to gain info.  
   * They push into scenes that obviously risk mental disintegration.  
2. PCs can spend **Insight** to:  
   * Ask pointed questions: e.g., “What is the Gu Patriarch afraid of?”  
   * **Hold the Pattern**: delay the worst Revelation condition for a scene.  
3. **Stain Track**:  
   * Each Revelation Attack with Backlash or domain-touching exposure marks **Stain**.  
   * At Stain Strain:  
     * PCs suffer −1 to Mind-based rolls and more vivid, intrusive visions.  
   * At Stain Overflow:  
     * GM triggers a major event:  
       * Temporary possession by the Hive.  
       * Forced Shattered/Broken state until an exorcism.  
       * A permanent Complication (“Mind Partially Shared with Hive”).

---

## **5.4.5 Resolution**

* PCs succeed when:  
  * “Understand the Hive’s Pattern” fills, giving them:  
    * The Patriarch’s next move,  
    * The location of the Nest,  
    * A weakness they can exploit.  
* Consequences:  
  * On success: they gain a new Domain (“Hive-Linked Insight”) and tactical advantages vs the Patriarch.  
  * On failure: “Hive’s Claim on Minds” fills first; one or more PCs leave with severe Stain, new Complications, and the Patriarch gains information about them.

# **Quickstart Packet Outline**

This is a top-level structure for a **Quickstart PDF** that showcases the system using the archetypes and bosses you have.

## **Q.1 1-Page Rules Summary**

**Q.1.1 Core Resolution**

* **Roll:** d20 \+ Trait vs DC or opposed Defense.  
* **Attack Sequence:**  
  1. Roll **Attack** vs **Defense** (pillar-specific).  
  2. On hit, target rolls **Resilience** vs `10 + Effect rank`.  
  3. Degrees of failure on the Resilience roll apply conditions (Violence, Influence, Revelation ladders).

**Q.1.2 Degrees of Success/Failure**

* 0 degrees: success / no effect.  
* 1 degree: minor condition (Injured, Rattled, Shaken).  
* 2 degrees: serious condition (Maimed, Discredited, Haunted).  
* 3 degrees: near-taken-out (Mortally Wounded, Isolated, Deranged).

**Q.1.3 SCL, Caps & PDB (Simplified)**

* **SCL ≈ Power Level / 2\.**  
* At SCL 2:  
  * Balanced OffCap/DefCap \= 8\.  
* **Power Draws Blood** profile per pillar:  
  * Balanced: OffCap & DefCap equal.  
  * Blood-Forward: \+2 OffCap, −2 DefCap (hits harder, breaks faster).  
  * Ward-Forward: −2 OffCap, \+2 DefCap (more tanky, less lethal).

**Q.1.4 Effects Overview**

* **Strike (Violence)** – damage, physical harm.  
* **Influence Attack (Influence)** – social/reputational harm.  
* **Revelation Attack (Revelation)** – sanity & comprehension harm.

* **Ward** – pillar-specific protection.

**Q.1.5 Tracks & Meta**

* Tracks: **Blood**, **Fate**, **Stain**.  
  * Fill these by using risky powers and enduring stress.  
  * Strain: penalties \+ meta-currency gain.  
  * Overflow: major crash (injury, social disaster, corruption).  
* Meta-currency:  
  * **Fury / Clout / Insight**:  
    * Rerolls, bonuses, cap pushes, narrative declarations, stalling conditions.

**Key Showcases:**

* Revelation Attack & Debilitate.  
* Insight usage.  
* Stain Strain/Overflow and how that can turn a battle.

---

If you’d like to keep going, the next steps that naturally follow are:

1. Take the **Ratings Witch** or **Gu Pattern Reader** and give them the same full playbook treatment as the Cinder-Fist Exorcist (pre-filled stat block \+ power packages).  
2. Draft a proper **Quickstart character sheet** template that mirrors 4.8 and the playbook structures.  
3. Write the **1–2 page GM Quickstart**, summarising:  
   * How to build/adjust bosses using the Rank system.  
   * How to frame scenes in each pillar.  
   * How to use Fate/Stain/Blood overflow beats as intentional drama spikes.

Below are two deliverables in SRD-friendly form:

1. A **Quickstart Character Sheet Template** that mirrors 4.8 \+ the playbook structure.  
2. A **GM Quickstart** (1–2 pages worth of content) summarising boss ranks, pillar-focused scene framing, and how to use Blood/Fate/Stain overflow as deliberate drama beats—aligned with good industry quickstart practice.

---

## **Quickstart Character Sheet Template**

Use this as the **layout spec** for a one- or two-page character sheet. The labels and order are designed to match Chapter 4 and section 4.8.

### **1\. Header Block – Identity & Tier**

**1.1 Identity**

* Character Name:  
* Title / Callsign:  
* Player:

Add a small “band check” reminder:

Offense Band: Attack \+ Effect rank (+ virtual ranks) ≤ OffCap(pillar).  
Defense Band: Defense \+ Resilience (+ active Ward) ≤ DefCap(pillar).

---

### **4\. Effects & Power Packages (3.3.x)**

This section should have enough space for **2–4 main powers**, plus any minor utilities.

---

## **GM Quickstart (1–2 Pages)**

A minimal “read this and you can run” section, strongly inspired by well-reviewed GM best-practice guides: start simple, set clear stakes, and be generous with rulings rather than rules lawyering.

---

### **G.1 Your Job in This Game**

**G.1.1 What You Do**

As GM, you:

1. **Frame scenes** in one or more pillars (Violence / Influence / Revelation).  
2. **Play the world and threats honestly**, within the caps and boss ranks.  
3. **Use Blood/Fate/Stain tracks** as drama tools:  
   * Strain \= rising tension.  
   * Overflow \= big, memorable moments (boss stage changes, heroic crash scenes).  
4. **Keep the focus on cinematic decisions**:  
   * “What are you willing to risk (blood, fate, stain) to win?”

You do **not** need to memorise every rule; you need to understand **bands, tracks, and degrees of success**.

### **G.2 Building & Adjusting Bosses (Rank System)**

**G.2.1 Boss Rank Bands**

Relative to a 3-PC SCL 2 party (≈ 60 SCP each, 180 SCP total):

* **Rank 1:** \~150% party power – 1.5×  
* **Rank 2:** \~175% party power – 1.75×  
* **Rank 3:** \~200–225% party power – 2–2.25×  
* **Rank 4:** \~250–300% party power – 2.5–3×  
* **Rank 5:** \~300–350% party power – 3–3.5×

Use this **as a guideline**, not an exact SCP budget: bosses are allowed to be “cheaty,” but they should feel **roughly** that much stronger.

**G.2.2 Quick Boss Build Checklist**

1. **Pick SCL:**  
   * Start at party SCL \+ 1 for serious bosses (e.g., party at SCL 2 → boss at SCL 3 or 4).  
2. **Pick Rank:**  
   * Decide if this boss is **episode-level** (Rank 1–2) or **season-level** (Rank 3–5).  
3. **Assign PDB Profiles:**  
   * Choose one primary pillar to be **Blood-Forward** (their main attack mode).  
   * Optionally, choose one pillar to be **Ward-Forward** (their main shield).  
4. **Set Bands:**  
   * From SCL and PDB, get OffCap/DefCap per pillar.  
   * For main pillar:  
     * Set Attack \~ half the OffCap.  
     * Set Effect rank so Attack \+ Effect (+ virtual ranks) is **at or just under** OffCap.  
   * For defenses:  
     * Set Defense \+ Resilience at or near DefCap on the pillar they’re tough in.  
5. **Pick 2–4 Powers:**  
   * 1–2 signature attacks in their main pillar (Strike / Influence Attack / Revelation Attack).  
   * 1 Debilitate matching their theme.  
   * 1 Ward that makes sense for their Domain.  
6. **Add Stage / Phase:**  
   * For Rank 4–5 bosses:  
     * Define at least **two stages**:  
       * Stage change on HP threshold or track Overflow.  
       * Flip PDB profiles or pillar focus (e.g., Revelation → Violence).  
7. **Conflict Dials:**  
   * If playtest shows boss obliterates PCs:  
     * Drop 2 points from Attack or rank in their main effect.  
     * Reduce DefCap (remove a Ward or lower Resilience).  
   * If boss is too easy:  
     * Add 1–2 virtual ranks (Extras) to their main effect.  
     * Add 1–2 boxes to one of their tracks to feel more durable.

### **G.3 Framing Scenes by Pillar**

**G.3.1 Violence Scenes – Fights & Chases**

* **What they look like:**  
  * Physical combat, pursuit, standoffs.  
* **Mechanics in focus:**  
  * Strike, Violence Debilitate, Body Ward.  
  * Violence OffCap/DefCap.  
  * Blood track & Fury.  
* **GM tips:**  
  * Provide **terrain and objects** that PCs can leverage (covers, ledges, dangerous Gu jars).  
  * Offer **meaningful consequences** (injury, Ruined Body, property damage) but telegraph them.  
  * Remember: **Blood Strain** is your cue to ramp up stakes (reinforcements arrive, timers start).

**G.3.2 Influence Scenes – Politics, PR, Social Warfare**

* **What they look like:**  
  * Negotiations, debates, trials, smear campaigns.  
* **Mechanics in focus:**  
  * Influence Attack, Debilitate (Influence), Soul Ward.  
  * Clout & Fate tracks.  
* **GM tips:**  
  * Frame clear **social objectives** (“Win the media battle,” “Convince the council”).  
  * Use **faction clocks** to represent shifting support (5.1).  
  * When PCs hit **Fate Strain**, show allies getting antsy or sceptical; at Overflow, drop a big twist (betrayal, scandal break).

**G.3.3 Revelation Scenes – Investigation, Domains, Horror**

* **What they look like:**  
  * Domain delves, experiments with forbidden Gu, parsing prophetic visions.  
* **Mechanics in focus:**  
  * Revelation Attack, Debilitate (Revelation), Mind Ward.  
  * Insight & Stain tracks.  
* **GM tips:**  
  * Present **layered clues**, with safer surface info and deeper knowledge requiring risky Revelation exposure.  
  * At **Stain Strain**, increase intensity of visions and partial truths.  
  * At **Overflow**, unleash a major event: possession, breakdown, or domain-altering shift.

### **G.4 Using Overflow as Planned Drama, Not Punishment**

**G.4.1 Treat Overflow as a Beat, Not a “Gotcha”**

Overflow on Blood, Fate, or Stain should be:

* **Foreshadowed**:  
  * Players see boxes filling.  
  * You remind them at Strain: “You’re one step from pushing too far.”  
* **Dramatic**:  
  * Overflow should change the scene in a big, memorable way:  
    * Blood: heroic last stand, collapse, or brutal injury.  
    * Fate: social status flip, powerful ally turning, scandal explosion.  
    * Stain: reality fracture, possession, or monstrous transformation.  
* **Meaningful but survivable** (most of the time):  
  * Use Overflow to **reposition** PCs in the fiction, not to annihilate them without warning.

**G.4.2 Tying Overflow to Boss Stages**

For bosses:

* Decide which track controls **stage changes**:  
  * e.g., Gu Patriarch → Stain Overflow triggers Stage 2 “Flesh Hive Avatar.”  
* When that Overflow hits:  
  * Change bosses’ PDB profile and pillar focus (Revelation → Violence, etc.).  
  * Add or swap powers (Revelation Attack drops; Strike gains Area/Brutal).  
* This gives you a built-in **“phase change” mechanic** reminiscent of multi-phase MMO and action-game bosses, but structured by tracks rather than HP alone. (The idea of boss phases as milestones is a common pattern in RPG and digital-game design.)

### **G.5 GM Principles to Keep in Mind**

1. **Start simple, then layer.**  
   * For early sessions, keep bosses 1-stage and focus on **one pillar** per scene. Broader multi-pillar conflicts can come later.  
2. **Signal risk and reward.**  
   * Make clear what Blood/Fate/Stain risks are, and what Fury/Clout/Insight might buy if they push anyway.  
3. **Fiction first, then math.**  
   * Let players pitch cool actions; then choose the pillar and effect that best model it.  
4. **Use Complications and Domains.**  
   * Bring in PCs’ Complications and Domains to tie mechanics to story: Gu-touched PCs, media darlings, and domain-divers should all see their sheet decisions matter.  
5. **End sessions on a spike.**  
   * Try to end of a **track Strain or Overflow** moment, or a boss stage flip—players will want to come back to see how it resolves.

If you’d like to continue, a natural next move is to:

* Take the **Ratings Witch** and **Gu Pattern Reader** and turn each into a full Quickstart playbook page using the same template as Cinder-Fist, so your Quickstart can ship with a complete 4–6 character spread ready to go.
