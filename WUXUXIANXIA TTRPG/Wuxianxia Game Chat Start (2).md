Below is a “rulebook-ready” effects section built around your chosen options for Q1–Q5 and the Power Draws Blood / cost-track motif.

You can drop this straight into a draft and expand examples as needed.

---

# **Core Effects Framework**

### **SCL, CL, SL and Bands (Reference)**

* **Core Level (CL)** \= ⌊(Body \+ Mind \+ Soul) / 3⌋

* **Soul Level (SL)** \= ⌊(Control \+ Fate \+ Spirit) / 3⌋

* **Soul Core Level (SCL)** \= CL \+ SL

* **Sequence Rank (Seq)** ≈ SCL (used for Realm/Tier naming)

SCL is the **hidden “power level” cap** the GM tracks; players mostly see it indirectly through bands and Sequence naming.

### **Conflict Pillars & Conditions**

* **Violence (Body pillar)**

  * Conditions: **Injured → Maimed → Mortally Wounded → Ruined Body**

* **Influence (Soul pillar)**

  * Conditions: **Rattled → Discredited → Isolated → Shattered/Broken**

* **Revelation (Mind pillar)**

  * Conditions: **Shaken → Haunted → Deranged → Shattered/Broken**

At **4th degree** in Influence or Revelation you are **Shattered/Broken**:

You are mentally and/or spiritually taken out in this context: publicly ruined, emotionally disconnected, mentally frayed, politically sidelined, or fully controlled as a mouthpiece; or spiritually taken out (catatonia, fugue state, total compromise to an entity/pathway, etc.). Reversal normally requires major narrative actions (exorcisms, interventions, existential bargains, sustained social campaigns), not a single recovery roll.

At 4th degree in Violence you are **Ruined Body** (dead, crippled, or maimed beyond ordinary medical repair without serious intervention).

### **Offense & Defense Bands**

Per pillar (Violence, Influence, Revelation):

* **Offense Band:**

  * Attack \+ Power Rank ≤ **2 × SCL** (before Power Draws Blood adjustment)

  * Each individually ≤ **SCL \+ 2**

* **Defense Band:**

  * Defense \+ Resilience ≤ **2 × SCL**

  * Each individually ≤ **SCL \+ 2**

* A character may have **only one pillar** at its full 2 × SCL Defense Band; at least one other pillar must be ≤ **1.5 × SCL** total, to avoid omni-defensive builds.

**Resilience** is the “soak” or durability component of a pillar (e.g. Body Resilience from Endurance \+ Armor, Soul Resilience from Resolve \+ Wards, etc.).

### **Power Draws Blood Profiles (Build-Time Only)**

For **each pillar**, at character creation you choose **one profile**:

1. **Balanced**

   * Offense Band: Attack \+ Power ≤ 2 × SCL

   * Defense Band: Defense \+ Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL

2. **Blood-Forward (Glass Cannon)**

   * Offense Band: Attack \+ Power ≤ 2 × SCL **\+ 2**

   * Defense Band: Defense \+ Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL **− 2**

3. **Ward-Forward (Bulwark)**

   * Defense Band: Defense \+ Resilience ≤ 2 × SCL **\+ 2**

   * Offense Band: Attack \+ Power ≤ 2 × SCL **− 2**

Within a band, you can further specialize:

* **Accuracy-leaning:** \+2 Attack, −2 Power (still within Offense Band).

* **Power-leaning:** \+2 Power, −2 Attack.

* **Evasion-leaning:** \+2 Defense, −2 Resilience.

* **Toughness-leaning:** \+2 Resilience, −2 Defense.

This is how the “+/- 2 to Offensive and Defensive Measures” manifests mechanically.

### **Meta-Currencies & Cost Tracks**

* **Positive Pools (per pillar):**

  * **Fury** – Violence pillar.

  * **Clout** – Influence pillar.

  * **Insight** – Revelation pillar.

* **Cost Tracks (per character):**

  * **Blood** – bodily strain, physical self-harm.

  * **Fate** – entanglement with oaths, obligations, cosmic or political debt.

  * **Stain** – corruption, loss of self, spiritual/moral erosion.

Effects may let you:

* **Spend Fury / Clout / Insight** for bonuses (rerolls, \+2 to a roll, minor narrative shifts).

* **Mark Blood / Fate / Stain** when using especially harsh, reality-warping, or reputation-shredding versions of effects, or when hitting 3rd–4th degree conditions.

  # **Trimmed Core Effects List**

For each effect below:

* **Balance Tag** uses your taxonomy: Balanced / Niche / Strong (Broken/Overpowered are excluded here by design).

* Costs are given in **PP per rank**; modifiers (Extras/Flaws) can be added later.

  ---

  ## **1\. Offensive & Debuff Effects**

  ### **1.1 Strike (Core Damage)**

**Balance Tag:** Balanced  
 **Pillar:** Typically **Violence** (can be adapted to other pillars as stress effects).

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Attack; Standard Action; Single Target.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Roll:** Violence Attack vs target’s **Body Defense**.

* **Effect:** Target resists with **Body Resilience** vs DC **10 \+ Strike rank**.

  * Failure by 1–4: **Injured**

  * Failure by 5–9: **Maimed**

  * Failure by 10–14: **Mortally Wounded**

  * Failure by 15+: **Ruined Body** (GM may gate this behind special circumstances)

**Descriptors (examples)**

* “Gu Fangs” – a swarm of microscopic Gu-teeth shredding flesh.

* “Cursed Blade” – soul-eating sword-strokes.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Strike is the **baseline Violence effect** for **Blood-Forward builds**.

* Being Blood-Forward in Violence lets you have **Attack \+ Strike rank up to 2 × SCL \+ 2**, but your Violence Defense Band is 2 × SCL − 2\.

* No automatic cost-track mark for a normal Strike; however, the GM may rule that attacks which **intentionally aim for Ruined Body** in non-lethal contexts mark **Stain** or **Fate**.

  ---

  ### **1.2 Debilitate (Affliction by Pillar)**

**Balance Tag:** Balanced → Strong (depending on rank, extras, and ladder depth)  
 **Pillar:** Violence, Influence, or Revelation depending on track targeted.

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Attack; Standard Action; Single Target (Area is possible but should be capped tightly and often mark costs).

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Roll:** Relevant pillar Attack vs target’s corresponding **Defense**.

* **Effect:** Target resists with the corresponding **Resilience** vs DC **10 \+ Debilitate rank**.

  * **Violence Debilitate**:

    * Failure 1–4: **Injured**

    * 5–9: **Maimed**

    * 10–14: **Mortally Wounded**

    * 15+: **Ruined Body**

  * **Influence Debilitate:**

    * Failure 1–4: **Rattled**

    * 5–9: **Discredited**

    * 10–14: **Isolated**

    * 15+: **Shattered/Broken**

  * **Revelation Debilitate:**

    * Failure 1–4: **Shaken**

    * 5–9: **Haunted**

    * 10–14: **Deranged**

    * 15+: **Shattered/Broken**

**Descriptors (examples)**

* Violence: “Bone-locking Curse”, “Meridian Needle Technique”.

* Influence: “Smear Campaign”, “Divine Censure”, “Gu Whisper” (rumours and fear).

* Revelation: “Show the Gu-Quark Truth”, “Open the Celestial Ledger”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* **Strong use:** If a Debilitate effect is built to **routinely reach 3rd or 4th degree** at-tier (e.g., high rank \+ Accurate \+ Area), it should:

  * Either be flagged **Strong** and gated by a **cost** (e.g. mark **Fate** or **Stain** on every use that pushes to 3rd degree),

  * Or be restricted to **limited uses per scene**.

* As a general rule:

  * **Influence Debilitate** that causes **Isolated** or **Shattered/Broken** tends to mark **Fate** (burned bridges, oaths broken, reputations shattered).

  * **Revelation Debilitate** that drives someone **Deranged / Shattered** often marks **Stain** (you stare into the abyss with them).

  ---

  ### **1.3 Drain (Weaken / Strip)**

**Balance Tag:** Niche → Balanced (when tightly scoped)  
 **Pillar:** Any (applied to numerical stats, defenses, or bands).

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Attack; Standard Action; Single Target.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Roll:** Appropriate pillar Attack vs target Defense.

* **Effect:** On a failed Resilience check vs DC **10 \+ Drain rank**, reduce a **narrow trait** by 1 rank per degree (up to a defined maximum).

  * Traits might include: one Defense, one Resilience, one type of Attack, or one specific stat (e.g., Endurance).

**Descriptors (examples)**

* “Qi Suppression Seal”.

* “Scandal Excavation” (draining Clout).

* “Mind Leech Gu”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Drain that hits **meta-economy** (e.g., directly draining **Fury/Clout/Insight**) should be considered **Strong** and:

  * Cost extra PP per rank,

  * And/or mark **Fate/Stain** when used aggressively (you unmake someone’s luck or destiny).

  ---

  ### **1.4 Push / Pull (Kinetic Control)**

**Balance Tag:** Balanced  
 **Pillar:** Violence (primary); can be skinned as Influence (social repositioning) or Revelation (mind dislocation) in some builds.

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Attack; Standard Action; Single Target or small group.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Roll:** Violence Attack vs Body Defense (or other pillar vs its Defense, with GM approval).

* **Effect:** On failed Resilience check:

  * Target is moved a distance based on degrees of failure (short → medium → long → slammed into hazard), possibly with **Injured/Maimed** if they hit something dangerous.

**Descriptors (examples)**

* “Gu Swarm Lift” – microscopic Gu carry or slam targets.

* “Telekinetic Throw”.

* Influence-flavoured: “Dragged out of the Room” via political leverage.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* If Push/Pull is used to cause **high-speed impacts or environmental Ruined Body results**, repeated use may mark **Blood** (physical self-stress) or **Stain** (using inherently cruel tactics).

  ---

  ## **2\. Movement & Positioning Effects**

  ### **2.1 Flight (Movement Suite Baseline)**

**Balance Tag:** Strong (intentionally the “gold standard” movement effect)

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Movement; Sustained or Continuous; personal.

* **Base Cost:** 2 PP per rank (or 1 PP with tighter caps, depending on how strong you want it).

* **Effect:** Grants high-speed, 3D movement. Higher ranks allow longer distances per move and environmental advantages.

**Descriptors**

* “Gu Wings”, “Cursed Sword Levitation”, “Celestial Wind Steps”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Flight itself does **not** mark cost tracks.

* However, **Blood-Forward Violence builds** that rely heavily on Flight for defence (evasion) should be encouraged to take **lower Body Resilience**—their evasion is great, but if hit, they suffer.

  ---

  ### **2.2 Dash (Ground Speed / Blink Step)**

**Balance Tag:** Balanced

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Movement; personal.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Effect:** Enhanced Speed or short **Step**/teleports-in-line-of-sight, letting you rapidly reposition without full Teleport freedom.

**Descriptors**

* “Shadow Step”, “Lightning Meridian Stride”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Rarely marks cost on its own; it is a **mobility tax** that Balanced builds pay instead of Flight.

  ---

  ### **2.3 Teleport (Short-Range)**

**Balance Tag:** Strong (heavily restricted)

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Movement; personal; Standard or Move Action.

* **Base Cost:** 2 PP per rank.

* **Effect:** You vanish from one point and reappear in another within a maximum distance defined by rank (short-range within the scene by default).

**Restrictions & Costs**

* Long-range or **blind** Teleport:

  * Requires **GM permission and/or Extra**,

  * And **always marks Stain or Fate** when used at maximum range (you are tearing through reality or dealing with pathwalkers).

**Descriptors**

* “Gu Tunneling”, “Domain Shift”, “Heavenly Flash”.

  ---

  ## **3\. Defense, Mitigation, and Control Effects**

  ### **3.1 Armor / Wards (Resilience Boosts)**

**Balance Tag:** Balanced

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Passive or Sustained; personal.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Effect:** Adds to a pillar’s **Resilience** (Body, Mind, or Soul), up to the relevant band cap (Defense \+ Resilience ≤ band).

**Descriptors**

* Body: “Reinforced Gu Carapace”, “Blessed Plate”.

* Mind: “Mental Ward Seals”.

* Soul: “Ancestor Veil”, “Cursed Halo”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* For **Ward-Forward builds**, Armor/Wards are where you spend your extra \+2 Defense Band.

* Excessive, layered Wards that shrug off Revelation or Influence for free should be flagged **Strong** and may:

  * Require rare materials/rituals (fictional cost),

  * Or slowly mark **Stain** (your soul hides behind too many walls).

  ---

  ### **3.2 Guard (Deflect-lite)**

**Balance Tag:** Niche → Balanced (with tight limits)

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Reaction or Standard Action; short range; affects one ally or small group.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Effect:**

  * Allows you to roll a **Guard check** (d20 \+ Guard rank) to replace an ally’s Defense vs one incoming attack, OR

  * Provides a **flat \+2/+5** bonus to Defenses in a small zone for one round (depending on how you want to scale it).

**Constraints**

* Cannot be built with “stack all the Extras” patterns:

  * No Reaction \+ Area \+ Selective \+ unlimited uses.

  * Typically limited to **1–2 uses per round**.

**Descriptors**

* “Gu Shield Swarm”, “Interposed Cursed Blade”, “Celestial Counterspell”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* If Guard is used as a **hard counter** to big Violence or Revelation effects, the GM can rule that:

  * On a critical success, you may mark **Blood** to also reflect some harm back.

  * On a critical failure, you mark **Blood or Stain** as the backlash hits you instead.

  ---

  ### **3.3 Barrier (Create-lite, Static)**

**Balance Tag:** Balanced

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Standard Action; creates one or more static terrain features.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Effect:**

  * Creates a **Barrier** with a certain Toughness/Resilience (usually equal to rank) that blocks movement, line of sight, or line of effect.

  * Climbing, breaking, or bypassing it requires checks vs its Resilience.

**Descriptors**

* “Gu Hive Wall”, “Stone Talisman Dome”, “Media Firewall” (data barriers in a more modern setting).

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Generally does not mark cost tracks by itself.

* If Barrier is used to trap someone in a **lethal or sanity-destroying situation**, repeated such uses may mark **Fate** or **Stain**.

  ---

  ### **3.4 Narrow Immunity**

**Balance Tag:** Niche → Balanced (if kept very narrow)

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Passive.

* **Base Cost:** Typically 1–2 PP per **very narrow** Immunity; broader ones cost more and should be rare.

* **Effect:** You ignore a specific, controlled category of harm, such as:

  * Your own Gu,

  * The backlash from your personal Cursed Technique,

  * A single environmental hazard.

**Descriptors**

* “Immune to my own Domain collapse.”

* “Immune to the Gu breed that lives in my body.”

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Very broad immunities (e.g. “immune to all mental effects”) should be banned or rewritten.

* Some narrow immunities can be paired with **Stain**: you are immune because you are becoming that threat.

  ---

  ## **4\. Information, Influence & Illusion Effects**

  ### **4.1 Enhanced Senses**

**Balance Tag:** Balanced

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Passive or Sustained.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per level of enhanced sense package.

* **Effect:** Expanded perception: see in darkness, sense Gu auras, read intent, perceive lies, etc.

**Descriptors**

* “Gu-Sense”, “Celestial Insight Sight”, “Media Feed Overlay”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* If tied into Revelation (seeing truths humans shouldn’t):

  * May **mark Stain** when repeatedly used to pierce cosmic veils.

  ---

  ### **4.2 Mind Pierce (Mind Reading-lite)**

**Balance Tag:** Strong (strictly controlled)

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Revelation attack vs Soul or Mind; Standard Action; single target.

* **Base Cost:** 2 PP per rank (premium pricing).

* **Roll:** Revelation Attack vs Mind or Soul Defense.

* **Effect:** On failed Resilience check, you read surface thoughts; additional degrees reveal deeper memories or hidden fears, subject to GM veto.

**Constraints**

* Must be **Limited**: no Area, no infinite-range, no “you never know I tried”.

* Ideally requires **eye contact, ritual, or consent**, or costs extra PP.

**Descriptors**

* “Open the Gu Ledger”, “Celestial Audit”, “Dream-Reading”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Every use that digs beyond surface thoughts (2nd+ degree success) should **mark Stain** (you’re not meant to rummage in souls for free).

* Some playbooks may instead mark **Fate** (you become entangled with what you learn).

  ---

  ### **4.3 Glamour / Veil (Illusion)**

**Balance Tag:** Niche → Balanced

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Influence/Revelation hybrid; Standard Action; Area or single target.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank.

* **Effect:** Create illusory sensory data that:

  * Inflicts penalties to Perception or Insight,

  * Or forces targets to resist with Mind or Soul Resilience to avoid **Shaken/Haunted** conditions when the illusions are horror-flavoured.

**Descriptors**

* “Gu Mirage”, “Media Spin Filter”, “Hall of Mirrors Domain”.

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Simple glamours (cosmetic disguises) are usually cost-free.

* Horror illusions that push toward **Haunted / Deranged** should, on repeated use, **mark Stain**.

  ---

  ### **4.4 Blessing / Hex (Long-Term Buff/Debuff)**

**Balance Tag:** Niche

**Rules Block**

* **Type:** Utility; extended action; target single person or small group.

* **Base Cost:** 1 PP per rank (buff or debuff magnitude).

* **Effect:**

  * Buff: temporarily boosts a stat or trait by 1–2 ranks (still respecting caps) for a session or arc.

  * Hex: applies a mild, ongoing penalty or vulnerability to a specific type of effect.

**Descriptors**

* “Gu Contract”, “Heavenly Blessing Seal”, “Cursed Hashtag Campaign” (media).

**Power Draws Blood & Costs**

* Blessings often mark **Fate** (obligations to the entity granting them).

* Hexes, especially those that ride on Revelation or Influence, mark **Stain** or **Fate** depending on flavour.

  ---

  ## **5\. Excluded or Heavily Rewritten Mechanics**

These are **not** part of the core effect list. If they appear, they should be treated as advanced, GM-only, or entirely rewritten variants.

1. **Metamorph / Multi-form “I am many character sheets”**

   * Flagged as **Broken** in the underlying analysis.

   * Replaced by:

     * **Arrays of effects** within a single statline, or

     * Summoning one named companion (with strict PP limits).

2. **Broad Transform-as-Variable**

   * No “Transform anything into anything” economy engines.

   * Transform, if used, is:

     * Either a **Debilitate** variant (e.g. turn people into statues with a clear condition ladder), or

     * A tightly-defined alternate form whose stats are explicitly costed.

3. **Luck Control that overrides GM fiat or creates infinite loops**

   * No effects that:

     * Force any roll to be rerolled indefinitely,

     * Or negate consequences after the fact without cost.

   * Limited, self-targeted rerolls are represented via **Fury/Clout/Insight spends**, not separate powers.

4. **Omni-minion swarms / wide Summon**

   * Minion mechanics are restricted to:

     * Narrative assets, or

     * One or two statted companions at **PC-appropriate PP costs**.

   * Massive armies are handled via **clocks and fronts**, not as on-sheet powers.

   ---

This gives you a **tight, effect-based chassis** where:

* SCL, CL, SL and your nine stats define caps and bands.

* Power Draws Blood manifests in build-time Offense/Defense and Accuracy/Power / Defense/Resilience profiles.

* Fury/Clout/Insight give each pillar a distinct way to “push”.

* Blood/Fate/Stain ensure that the biggest moves and harshest outcomes carry meaningful long-term consequences.

If you want, next we can:

* Turn each of these effect write-ups into **full rule text with Extras/Flaws** tables, or

* Build a few **example playbooks** that show how different Power Draws Blood profiles \+ effect choices create distinct archetypes in play.

*
